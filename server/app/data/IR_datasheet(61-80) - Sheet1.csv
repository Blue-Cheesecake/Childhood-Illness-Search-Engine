Epiglottitis,"Epiglottitis is inflammation and swelling of the epiglottis. It's often caused by an infection, but can sometimes occur as a result of a throat injury. Epiglottitis is regarded as a medical emergency. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you think you or your child has epiglottitis, (see symptoms section below).","The symptoms of epiglottitis usually develop quickly and get rapidly worse. Although the symptoms can develop over a few days in older children and adults.

Symptoms include:
- a severe sore throat
- difficulty and pain when swallowing
- difficulty breathing, which may improve when leaning forwards
- breathing that sounds abnormal and high-pitched (stridor)
- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
- irritability and restlessness
- muffled or hoarse voice
- drooling

The main symptoms of epiglottitis in young children are difficulty breathing, stridor and a hoarse voice.

In adults and older children, difficulty swallowing and drooling are the main symptoms.","Epiglottitis is treated in hospital. The first thing the medical team will do is secure the person's airways to make sure they can breathe properly.

#Securing the airways
An oxygen mask will be given to deliver highly concentrated oxygen to the person's lungs.

If this does not work, a tube will be placed in the person's mouth and pushed past their epiglottis into the windpipe. The tube will be connected to an oxygen supply.

In severe cases where there's an urgent need to secure the airways, a small cut may be made in the neck at the front of the windpipe so a tube can be inserted. The tube is then connected to an oxygen supply.

This procedure is called a tracheostomy and it allows oxygen to enter the lungs while bypassing the epiglottis.

An emergency tracheostomy can be carried out using local anaesthetic or general anaesthetic.

Once the airways have been secured and the person is able to breathe unrestricted, a more comfortable and convenient way of assisting breathing may be found.

This is usually achieved by threading a tube through the nose and into the windpipe.

Fluids will be supplied through a drip into a vein until the person is able to swallow.

Once this has been achieved and the situation is thought to be safe, some tests may be carried out.

Any underlying infection will be treated with a course of antibiotics.

With prompt treatment, most people recover from epiglottitis after about a week and are well enough to leave hospital after 5 to 7 days.","The most effective way to prevent your child getting epiglottitis is to make sure their vaccinations are up-to-date.

Children are particularly vulnerable to a Hib infection because they have an underdeveloped immune system.

Babies should be vaccinated against Hib as part of the 6-in-1 DTaP/IPV/Hib vaccine, which also protects against diphtheria, hepatitis B, tetanus, whooping cough and polio.

Contact your GP if you're not sure whether your child's vaccinations are up-to-date.

Due to the effectiveness of the Hib vaccination programme, epiglottitis is rare in Northern Ireland, and most cases now occur in adults.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/epiglottitis#toc-5
Falls,"Falls are a common cause of injury. Older people are more likely to fall, especially if they have a long-term health condition. If you fall and are hurt you should dial 999 for an ambulance.","Healthcare professionals take falls in older people very seriously, because of the consequences they can have for their health and wellbeing.

There’s a great deal of help and support available for older people. You can ask your GP about the various options. Your GP may carry out some simple tests to check your balance. They might review any medicines you're taking, in case their side effects may increase your risk of falling.

Your GP may also recommend:
- having a sight test if you're having problems with your vision, even if you already wear glasses
- having an electrocardiogram (ECG) and checking your blood pressure while lying and standing 
- requesting a home hazard assessment, where a healthcare professional visits your home to identify potential hazards and offer advice
- doing exercises or increasing activity to improve your strength and balance","Around one in three adults over 65 who live at home will have at least one fall a year.

Most falls don't result in serious injury. However, there's a risk that a fall could lead to broken bones. It can also cause the person to:
- lose confidence
- become withdrawn
- feel as if they've lost their independence

If you have a fall, it's important to keep calm.

#If you fall and you’re not hurt
If you're not hurt and you feel strong enough, use the following steps to get up:
- don't get up quickly
- roll onto your hands and knees
l- ook for a stable piece of furniture, such as a chair or bed to hold on to
- hold on to the furniture with both hands to support yourself and, when you feel ready, slowly get up
- sit down and rest for a while before carrying on with your daily activities

#If you fall and you’re hurt
If you're hurt or unable to get up, try to get someone's attention by:
- calling out for help
- banging on the wall or floor
- using your aid call button (if you have one)

If possible, crawl to a telephone and dial 999 to request an ambulance.

Whilst waiting for help you should:
- try to reach something warm, such as a blanket or dressing gown, to put over you, particularly your legs and feet
- stay as comfortable as possible
- try to change your position at least once every half an hour or so","There are several measures you can take to help prevent a fall. Simple everyday measures around the home include:

- using non-slip mats in the bathroom
- mopping up spills to prevent wet, slippery floors
- getting help lifting or moving items that are heavy or difficult to lift

Removing clutter and ensuring all areas of the home are well lit can also help to prevent falls. The charity Age UK has advice about how to make tasks easier around the home.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/falls#toc-0
Food poisoning,Food poisoning is an illness caused by eating contaminated food. It's not usually serious and most people get better within a few days without treatment.,"In most cases of food poisoning, the food is contaminated by bacteria, such as salmonella or Escherichia coli (E. coli), or a virus, such as the norovirus.

The symptoms of food poisoning usually begin within one to two days of eating contaminated food. Although the symptoms may begin at any point between a few hours and several weeks later.

The main symptoms include:
- feeling sick (nausea)
- vomiting
- diarrhoea, which may contain blood or mucus
- stomach cramps and abdominal (tummy) pain
- a lack of energy and weakness
- loss of appetite
- a high temperature (fever)
- aching muscles
- chills

In most cases, these symptoms will pass in a few days and you will make a full recovery.","Food poisoning can usually be treated at home without seeking medical advice. Most people will feel better within a few days.

It's important to avoid dehydration by drinking plenty of water, even if you can only sip it. You will need to replace any fluids lost through vomiting and diarrhoea.

You should also:

- rest as much as possible
- eat when you feel up to it - sticking to small, light and non-fatty meals at first (bland foods such as toast, crackers, rice and bananas are good choices)
- avoid alcohol, caffeine, fizzy drinks and spicy and fatty foods because they may make you feel worse

Contact your GP if your symptoms are severe or don't begin to improve in a few days.","The best way to avoid getting food poisoning is to make sure you maintain high standards of personal and food hygiene when storing, handling and preparing food.

The Food Standards Agency (FSA) recommends remembering the ’four Cs’:

cleaning
cooking
chilling
cross-contamination (avoiding it)

It's also recommended that you stick to a food’s ‘use by’ date and the storage instructions on the packet.

These steps are important because things such as a food's appearance and smell aren't a reliable way of telling if it's safe to eat.

Gallbladder cancer,"The gallbladder is a small, pouch-like organ found underneath the liver. Gallbladder cancer is a rare cancer. See your GP if you have symptoms of gallbladder cancer (see below), so you can get them investigated.","In the early stages, gallbladder cancer doesn't usually cause any symptoms. This means it's often diagnosed at a more advanced stage.

Symptoms that occur at a later stage can include:
- tummy pain
- feeling or being sick
- yellowing colour of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)

Other symptoms can include:
- not feeling hungry
- unexplained weight loss
- a swollen tummy
- dark yellow urine or pale-coloured poo (usually with jaundice)
- itchy skin","If you are diagnosed with gallbladder cancer, the health professional looking after your care will discuss treatment options with you.

The main treatment for gallbladder cancer is surgery to remove the gallbladder (cholecystectomy) and possibly some of the surrounding tissue.

It's safe to remove the gallbladder and it shouldn't affect your ability to digest food.

If the gallbladder cancer is too advanced to remove or it's spread to other organs (metastases), you won't have surgery.

Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are also sometimes used, either on their own or in combination with surgery.

The treatment or combination of treatments most suitable for you will depend on:
- the type of gallbladder cancer you have
- the stage of your cancer
- your overall level of health

The Cancer Research UK website has more information about staging gallbladder cancer, treating gallbladder cancer and the outlook for gallbladder cancer.","The exact cause of gallbladder cancer isn't known, but certain things are thought to increase your chances of developing it.

These include:
- older age - it's more common in people over the age of 70
- family history - you have a higher risk of developing gallbladder cancer if a parent, sibling or child has had the condition
- having another gallbladder condition - you have a higher risk if you have already had gallstones, inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), polyps in your gallbladder or a - condition called porcelain gallbladder
- being obese

Glandular fever,"Glandular fever is a type of viral infection. It can affect people of all ages, however most cases affect teenagers and young adults between 15-24 years of age.","Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). Symptoms are thought to take about one to two months to develop after infection with the virus.

The most common symptoms of the condition include:
- a high temperature (fever)
- a sore throat - this is usually severe, but in an older adult, or very young child, the infection may be present without a sore throat
- swollen glands (lymph nodes) in your neck and possibly in other parts of your body, such as under your armpits
- fatigue (extreme tiredness)

Glandular fever can also cause:
- a general sense of feeling unwell
- aching muscles
- chills
- sweats
- loss of appetite
- pain around or behind your eyes
- swollen tonsils and adenoids (small lumps of tissue at the back of the nose), which may affect your breathing
- the inside of your throat to become very red and there may be a whitish coating
- small red or purple spots on the roof of your mouth
- a rash
- swelling or ’puffiness’ around your eyes
- a tender or swollen tummy
- jaundice (yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes)

Some of these symptoms may develop a few days before the main symptoms mentioned above.

While the symptoms of glandular fever can be unpleasant, most of them should pass within two to three weeks. Fatigue, however, can occasionally last several months.","There is no cure for glandular fever. However, there are a number of simple treatments and measures that can help reduce the symptoms. These include:
- drinking plenty of fluids
- taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen
- getting plenty of rest and gradually increasing your activity as your energy levels improve

Occasionally, if your GP thinks this is necessary, other treatments may be needed if you develop complications of glandular fever.

Some people with particularly severe symptoms may need to be looked after in hospital for a few days.","Glandular fever is caused by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). This virus is found in the saliva of infected people and can be spread through:
- kissing - glandular fever is often called the ""kissing disease""
- exposure to coughs and sneezes
- sharing eating and drinking utensils, such as cups, glasses and unwashed cutlery

Haemochromatosis,"Haemochromatosis is an inherited condition in which iron levels in the body slowly build up over many years. This build-up of iron can cause unpleasant symptoms, (see below). See section on ‘when to see your GP’ if you have concerns that you might have hemochromatosis.

Haemochromatosis leads to a build-up of iron, known as iron overload. This can cause unpleasant symptoms. If it isn't treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart.

Haemochromatosis most often affects people of white northern European background. It is particularly common in countries where there are more people from a Celtic background, such as Northern Ireland.","Symptoms of haemochromatosis usually start between the ages of 30 and 60.

Common symptoms include:
- feeling very tired all the time (fatigue)
- weight loss
- weakness
- joint pain
- in men, an inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)
- in women, irregular periods or absent periods","There's currently no cure for haemochromatosis. There are treatments that can reduce the amount of iron in the body and reduce the risk of damage.

There are two main treatments.
- phlebotomy - a procedure to remove some of your blood; this may need to be done every week at first but can be done every few months once your iron level comes down to normal
- chelation therapy - where you take medication to reduce the amount of iron in your body; this is only used if it's not easy to regularly remove some of your blood

You don't need to make any big changes to your diet to control your iron levels if you're having treatment, but you'll usually be advised to avoid:
- breakfast cereals containing added iron
- iron or vitamin C supplements
- drinking too much alcohol","Haemochromatosis is caused by a faulty gene that affects how the body absorbs iron from food.

You're at risk of developing the condition if both of your parents have this faulty gene and you inherit one copy from each of them.

You won't get haemochromatosis if you only inherit one copy of the genetic fault, but there's a chance you could pass the faulty gene on to any children you have.

Even if you do inherit two copies, you won't necessarily get haemochromatosis. Only a small number of people with two copies of this genetic fault will ever develop the condition. It's not clear exactly why this is.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/haemochromatosis#toc-1
Hearing loss,Hearing loss is a common problem that often develops with age or is caused by repeated exposure to loud noises. Some people are born deaf or develop hearing loss at a young age through infection. This page has information on hearing loss including signs and why it can happen.,"#Signs of hearing loss 
Hearing loss is sometimes sudden, but often it's gradual and you may not notice it at first.

Being aware of the early signs can help you identify the problem quickly.

It's important to spot hearing loss as soon as possible. This is because treatment is often of more benefit if begun early.

#General signs of hearing loss 
Early signs of hearing loss can include:
- difficulty hearing other people clearly and misunderstanding what they say, especially in group situations
- asking people to repeat themselves
- listening to music or watching television with the volume higher than other people need
- difficulty hearing the telephone or doorbell
- finding it difficult to tell which direction noise is coming from
- regularly feeling tired or stressed, from having to concentrate while listening

In some cases, you may recognise signs of hearing loss in someone else before they notice it themselves. Research has suggested it takes 10 years from the time someone notices they have hearing loss, before they do anything about it.

If you also hear a ringing, buzzing or whistling sound in your ears, this could be a sign of tinnitus, which is often associated with hearing loss.

#Signs of hearing loss in children 
Babies are routinely screened within the first few weeks of their birth as part of the newborn hearing screening programme (NHSP).

However, there are signs you can look out for which may suggest you should see your GP to arrange another hearing test.

#Signs of hearing loss in babies 
You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your baby or toddler:
- isn't startled by loud noises
- doesn't turn towards the source of a sound while under four months old
- doesn't say single words by the time they're one year old
- notices you when they see you, but not when you call their name
- hears some sounds but not others

#Signs of hearing loss in children 
You should consider seeing your GP if you notice that your child:
- is slow to learn to talk, or they're not clear when they speak 
- often asks you to repeat yourself or responds inappropriately to a question
- doesn't reply when you call them
- often talks very loudly
- often turns up the volume of the TV so it's very loud
- watches other people to copy instructions, because they haven't heard

#When to see your GP 
See your GP if you're having problems with your hearing, or your child is showing signs of hearing difficulty. If you lose your hearing suddenly, in one or both ears, you must see your GP as soon as possible.

Your GP can check for any problems and may refer you to an audiologist (hearing specialist) or an ear, nose and throat surgeon for further tests.","The way hearing loss is treated depends on the cause and how severe it is.

In cases of sensorineural hearing loss, there are several options that may help to improve a person’s ability to hear and communicate.

These include:
- hearing aids - which are available through the Health and Social Care (HSC) Trusts, or from a number of outlets, if you choose to buy a hearing aid privately
- bone anchored implants - suitable for people who are unable to use hearing aids and for some levels of sensorineural hearing loss
- middle ear implants - suitable for some people who are unable to use hearing aids
- cochlear implants - for people who find hearing aids aren't powerful enough
- lip reading and/or sign language 

Conductive hearing loss is sometimes temporary and can be treated with medication or minor surgery, if necessary.

More major surgery may be required to fix the ear drum or hearing bones. If conventional hearing aids don't work, there are also some implantable devices for this type of hearing loss.","It isn't always possible to prevent hearing loss if you have an underlying condition that causes you to lose your hearing.

There are several things you can do to reduce the risk of hearing loss from long-term exposure to loud noise.

This includes:
- not having music or the television on at a loud volume at home
- using ear protection at loud music events or in noisy work environments

Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF),Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult. See your GP if you've struggled with your breathing for a while or have had a cough for more than three weeks. These symptoms aren't normal and shouldn't be ignored.,"The symptoms of IPF tend to develop gradually and get slowly worse over time.

Symptoms can include:
- shortness of breath
- a persistent dry cough
- tiredness
- loss of appetite and weight loss
- rounded and swollen fingertips (clubbed fingers)

Many people ignore their breathlessness at first and blame it on getting old or being out of shape. But eventually even light activity such as getting dressed can cause shortness of breath.","There's currently no cure for IPF. But there are several treatments that can help relieve the symptoms and slow down its progression. The health professional looking after your care will discuss treatment options with you.

Treatments include:
- self-care measures - such as stopping smoking, eating healthily and exercising regularly
- medication to reduce the rate at which scarring worsens
- breathing oxygen through a mask - you can do this while you're at home and/or while you're out and about
- pulmonary rehabilitation - exercises and advice to help you breathe more easily
- a lung transplant - this is suitable in a few cases, although donor lungs are rare","In people with IPF, the tiny air sacs in the lungs (alveoli) become damaged and increasingly scarred. This causes the lungs to become stiff. This means it's difficult for oxygen to get into the blood.

The reason this happens isn't clear. ""Idiopathic"" means the cause is unknown.

IPF has been linked to:
- exposure to certain types of dust, such as metal or wood dust
- viral infections
- a family history of IPF - around 1 in 20 people with IPF has another family member with the condition
- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD)

However, some stings can be painful and trigger a serious allergic reaction.","Insects that bite include midges, mosquitoes, fleas, bedbugs and, although not strictly insects, spiders, mites and ticks, which are arachnids. Insects that sting include bees, wasps and hornets.

An insect bites you by making a hole in your skin to feed. Most insects sting as a defence by injecting venom into your skin.

The severity of bites and stings varies depending on the type of insect involved and the sensitivity of the person.

In rare cases, some people can have a serious allergic reaction (anaphylaxis) to a bite or sting that requires immediate medical treatment.","Most bites and stings are treated by:
- washing the affected area with soap and water
- placing a cold compress (a flannel or cloth soaked in cold water) over the area to reduce swelling

Try not to scratch the affected area to avoid infection. If you're in pain or the area is swollen, take painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen (children under 16 years of age shouldn't be given aspirin).

The pain, swelling and itchiness can sometimes last a few days. Ask your pharmacist about over-the-counter treatments that can help, such as creams for itching and antihistamines.

If you have a more serious reaction, your GP may prescribe other medication or refer you to an allergy clinic for specialist assessment and treatment.","You're more likely to be bitten or stung if you work outdoors or regularly take part in outdoor activities, such as camping or hiking.

Using insect repellent and keeping your skin covered when outdoors will help you avoid being bitten or stung.

Along with jaundice you may also notice
- pale-coloured stools (poo)
- dark-coloured urine (wee)","Treatment for jaundice in adults and older children depends on what's causing it. This may involve treating the underlying condition, a blood transfusion or surgery.","It's not possible to prevent all cases of jaundice because it can be caused by a wide range of conditions or circumstances.

You can take precautions to minimise your risk of developing jaundice. These include:
- ensuring you don't exceed the recommended daily amount (RDA) for alcohol consumption
- maintaining a healthy weight for your height and build
- if appropriate, ensuring you're vaccinated against hepatitis A or hepatitis B if you're travelling to high-risk areas of the world
- minimising your risk of exposure to hepatitis C because there's currently no vaccine for the condition; the most effective way of preventing hepatitis C is by not injecting illegal drugs, such as heroin, or making sure that you don't share drug injecting equipment if you do",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/jaundice#toc-0

- a sudden pain in the muscles of the leg caused by an involuntary contracting (shortening) of the leg muscle
- most occur in the calf muscles and, less commonly, in the feet and thighs
- cramps can last from a few seconds up to 10 minutes - thigh muscle cramps tend to last the longest
- during cramping, the affected muscles will become tight and painful and the feet and toes will be stiff
- after the cramps have passed, you may have pain and tenderness in your legs for several hours","Most cases of leg cramps can be relieved by exercising the affected muscles. Exercising your legs during the day will often help reduce how often you get cramping.

#Stretches
To stretch your calf muscles:
- stand with the front half of your feet on a step, with your heels hanging off the edge
- slowly lower your heels so that they are below the level of the step
- hold for a few seconds before lifting your heels back up to the starting position
- repeat a number of times

Medication is usually only needed in the most persistent cases, where cramping does not respond to exercise.

If you have secondary leg cramps, treating the underlying cause may help relieve your symptoms.

Leg cramps that occur during pregnancy should pass after the baby is born.

Treating cramps that occur as a result of serious liver disease can be more difficult. Your treatment plan may include using medications such as muscle relaxants.","If you often get leg cramps, regularly stretching the muscles in your lower legs may help prevent the cramps or reduce their frequency.

You might find it useful to stretch your calves before you go to bed each night (see stretching advice above or try this post-exercise calf stretch).

The following night-time advice may also help:
- if you lie on your back, make sure that your toes point upwards - placing a pillow on its side at the end of your bed, with the soles of your feet propped up against it may help keep your feet in the right position 
- if you lie on your front, hang your feet over the end of the bed - this will keep your feet in a relaxed position and help stop the muscles in your calves from contracting and tensing
- keep your sheets and blankets loose",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/leg-cramps#toc-1
Malaria,"Malaria is a serious tropical disease spread by mosquitoes. If not diagnosed and treated quickly, it can be fatal. A single mosquito bite is all it takes to become infected. Seek medical help immediately if you develop symptoms during or after a visit to an area where malaria is found.","It's important to be aware of the symptoms of malaria if you're travelling to areas where there's a high risk of the disease. Symptoms include:

- a high temperature of 38C or above
- feeling hot and shivery
- headaches
- vomiting
- muscle pains
- diarrhoea
- anaemia
- jaundice

Symptoms usually appear between seven and 18 days after becoming infected. In some cases the symptoms may not appear for up to a year, or occasionally even longer.","If malaria is diagnosed and treated quickly, almost everyone will make a full recovery. Treatment should be started as soon as the diagnosis has been confirmed.

Antimalarial medication is used to both treat and prevent malaria. Which type of medication is used and the length of treatment will depend on:
- the type of malaria
- the severity of your symptoms
- where you caught malaria
- whether you took an antimalarial to prevent malaria 
- whether you're pregnant

In some cases, you may be prescribed emergency standby treatment for malaria before you travel. This is usually if there's a risk of you becoming infected with malaria while travelling in a remote area with little or no access to medical care.","Many cases of malaria can be avoided. An easy way to remember is the ABCD approach to prevention:

- Awareness of risk - find out whether you're at risk of getting malaria before travelling
- Bite prevention - avoid mosquito bites by using insect repellent, covering your arms and legs, and using an insecticide-treated mosquito net
- Check whether you need to take malaria prevention tablets - if you do, make sure you take the right antimalarial tablets at the right dose, and finish the course
- Diagnosis - seek immediate medical advice if you develop malaria symptoms (see above), as long as up to a year after you return from travelling

Speak to your GP if you're planning to visit an area where there's a malaria risk. It may be recommended that you take antimalarial tablets to prevent infection.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/malaria
Marfan syndrome,Marfan syndrome is a disorder of the body's connective tissues. These are a group of tissues that maintain the structure of the body and support internal organs and other tissues. Children usually inherit the disorder from one of their parents. There's no cure and treatment focuses on managing the symptoms.,"Some people are only mildly affected by Marfan syndrome, while others develop more serious symptoms.

Typical characteristics of Marfan syndrome include:
- being tall 
- abnormally long and slender limbs, fingers, and toes (arachnodactyly)
- heart defects
- lens dislocation - where the lens of the eye falls into an abnormal position","There's no cure for Marfan syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms and reducing the risk of complications.

One of the most serious problems caused by Marfan syndrome occurs if the heart and the aorta, the body's main artery, are significantly affected. This can lead to a lower life expectancy.","Marfan syndrome is a hereditary gene defect. This means it can be passed to a child from a parent who's affected.

In around three-quarters of cases, Marfan syndrome is inherited from one parent. The syndrome is autosomal dominant. This means a child can inherit it even if only one parent has the syndrome.

The gene defect leads to abnormal production of a protein called fibrillin. This results in parts of the body being able to stretch abnormally when placed under any kind of stress.

The defective fibrillin gene also causes some bones to grow longer than they should. This means a person with Marfan syndrome may be tall because their arms and legs grow longer than normal.

In the remaining cases, neither parent has the syndrome. The fibrillin gene changes (mutates) for the first time in the parent's egg or sperm. The mutated gene can be passed on to the child, who will then go on to develop the syndrome.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/marfan-syndrome#toc-0
Nail patella syndrome,"Nail patella syndrome is a rare genetic condition that can cause problems with the nails, bones and kidneys.","Almost everyone with nail patella syndrome has abnormal nails. Many people also have problems with their knee caps (patellae), elbows and pelvis.

Some of the problems will be obvious from birth. But others may not become clear until later on.

There are several symptoms and problems associated with nail patella syndrome.

#Nails
Nails may be missing, underdeveloped, discoloured, split, ridged or pitted.

Thumbnails are most severely affected, with each fingernail being less severely affected from the index finger to the little finger.

Toenails are usually less affected by the condition.

#Kneecaps
The kneecaps may be missing, small, irregularly shaped and easily dislocated, and can click, lock or may feel unstable or painful.

#Arms and elbows
Some people aren't able to fully extend their arms or turn their palms up while keeping their elbows straight. The elbows may also angle outwards, and dislocations can occur.

#Pelvis
Bony growths on the pelvic bone (visible on X-rays) are common, but don't usually cause problems.

#Kidneys
There may be protein in the urine (an early sign of kidney problems), which can be accompanied by blood in the urine. This can sometimes progress to kidney disease.

People with nail patella syndrome may also have:
- increased pressure in the eyes (glaucoma) at an early age
- numbness, tingling or a burning sensation in the hands and feet
- poor blood circulation in the hands and feet
- constipation or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- difficulty putting on weight, particularly muscle
- thin bones (osteoporosis), particularly in the hips
- a high forehead and hairline","There's no cure for nail patella syndrome. But treatments are available to help manage the symptoms.

#Kneecap and joint problems
If your kneecaps are easily dislocated and painful, painkillers, physiotherapy, splinting and bracing may help.

But the long-term use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be avoided because they can affect the kidneys.

Some people may need corrective surgery for problems with the bones and joints. This should be carried out after an MRI scan by a surgeon who understands the condition.

#Regular tests
Urine tests should be carried out at birth to check for kidney problems. High levels of protein in the urine may need to be treated with medication.

Later on, your urine and blood pressure should be tested every year.

Kidney problems may occur during (or be made worse by) pregnancy in women who have nail patella syndrome.

It's recommended that pregnant women with the condition have their blood pressure taken and urine tested regularly.

Screening for glaucoma should start as soon as a child is able to co-operate with the examination.

Treatment for glaucoma may involve using eye drops or having a procedure to reduce the pressure inside the eye. 

A dental examination should be carried out at least every 6 months.

An assessment of bone density is recommended for young adults to check for osteoporosis.","Nail patella syndrome is usually caused by a fault in a gene called LMX1B that's inherited from one parent.

But there isn't always a family history of nail patella syndrome. In some cases, an LMX1B gene mutation (alteration) occurs for the first time on its own.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/nail-patella-syndrome
Neck pain or a stiff neck,Neck pain or a stiff neck is a common problem which usually gets better after a few days or weeks. It's rarely a sign of anything serious.,"You can often get a painful or stiff neck if you:

- sleep in an awkward position
- use a computer for an extended period of time
- strain a muscle because of bad posture

Anxiety and stress can also sometimes cause tension in your neck muscles, leading to neck pain.","For most types of general neck pain, the advice is to carry on with your normal daily activities, keep active, and take painkillers to relieve the symptoms.

These steps may help you to manage your pain:

- take regular doses of paracetamol, ibuprofen, or a combination of the two, to control pain - ibuprofen gel can be rubbed on to your neck as an alternative to taking tablets (always follow the instructions that come with the medication)
- try holding a hot water bottle or heat pack to your neck - this can help reduce the pain and any muscle spasms, although some people find cold packs offer better relief
- sleep on a low, firm pillow at night - using too many pillows may force your neck to bend unnaturally
- check your posture - bad posture can aggravate the pain, and it may have caused it in the first place
- avoid wearing a neck collar - there's no evidence to suggest wearing a neck collar will help to heal your neck, and it's generally better to keep your neck mobile
- avoid driving if you find it difficult to turn your head - this may prevent you being able to view traffic
- if your neck is stiff or twisted, try some neck exercises - gently tense your neck muscles as you tilt your head up and down and from side to side, and as you carefully twist your neck from left to right; these exercises will help strengthen your neck muscles and improve your range of movement","You may find the following advice helpful in preventing neck pain:

- make sure you have good posture - read about how to sit correctly, posture tips for laptop users, and common posture mistakes and fixes
- take regular breaks from your desk, from driving, or from any activity where your neck is held in the same position for a long period of time
- if you often feel stressed, try relaxation techniques to help ease any tension in your neck
- avoid sleeping on your front, and make sure your head is in line with your body (not tilted to the side) if you sleep on your side
- only use enough pillows (usually only one) to keep your head level with your body  
- make sure your mattress is quite firm - a soft mattress could mean your neck is bent while you sleep",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/neck-pain-and-stiff-neck#toc-0
Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis is a condition that causes joints to become painful and stiff. It's one of the most common types of arthritis in Northern Ireland. It can affect anyone but is more common in older people. You should see your GP if you have persistent symptoms of osteoarthritis.,"The main symptoms of osteoarthritis are:
- joint pain
- stiffness

Some people also experience:
- swelling
- tenderness
- a grating or crackling sound when moving the affected joints

The severity of symptoms can vary greatly from person to person, and between different affected joints.

For some people, symptoms can be mild and may come and go. Others can have more continuous and severe problems, making it difficult to carry out everyday activities.

Most joints can be affected by osteoarthritis. It most commonly affects:
- knee joints
- hip joints
- small joints of the hands","Osteoarthritis is a long-term condition and can't be cured. It doesn't necessarily get worse over time and it can sometimes gradually improve. Treatments are available to reduce the symptoms.

Mild symptoms can sometimes be managed with:
- regular exercise
- losing weight if you're overweight
- wearing suitable footwear
- using special devices to reduce the strain on your joints during everyday activities

If your symptoms are more severe, you may need additional treatments such as:
- painkilling medication
- a structured exercise plan carried out under the supervision of a physiotherapist

In some severe cases surgery may be carried out to repair, strengthen or replace a damaged joint.","It's not possible to prevent osteoarthritis altogether. However, you may be able to minimise your risk of developing it.

#Exercise
Avoid exercise that puts strain on your joints and forces them to bear an excessive load, such as:
- running
- weight training

Instead, try exercises such as:
- Swimming
- cycling

With these types of exercise joints are better supported and the strain is more controlled.

Try to do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) weekly to build up muscle strength and keep yourself healthy.

#Posture
Maintaining good posture can also help. You should avoid staying in the same position for too long. If you work at a desk, make sure your chair is at the right height. Take regular breaks to move around

#Losing weight
Being overweight or obese can increase the strain on your joints and increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis. Losing weight may help lower your chances of developing the condition.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/osteoarthritis#toc-0
