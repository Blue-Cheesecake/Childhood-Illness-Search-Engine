Oral thrush in babies,Oral thrush in babies and young children is a fungal infection in the mouth. It’s usually harmless and easily treatable. See section on ‘when to get medical advice’ below.,"#Signs of oral thrush in babies
- the main sign of oral thrush is a white coating on your baby's tongue - there may also be white patches elsewhere in the mouth
- this coating may look like curd or cottage cheese - it usually can't be rubbed off easily
- if the coating does rub off easily, it's more likely to be milk coating the tongue and not thrush
- babies may not seem bothered by the patches - they may be reluctant to feed - or keep detaching from the breast during feeds, if they're sore
- there may also be nappy rash caused by the same infection that needs to be treated as well

#When to seek medical advice
Oral thrush in babies isn't usually serious, but you should see your GP if your child is under two years of age. If your child is older your pharmacist may be able to help if you think your child may have the condition.

You can also ask your health visitor for advice. If you need advice from a GP when your doctor is not available, you can contact the GP out of hours services.

If there's any doubt about the diagnosis, your GP may take a swab from your baby's mouth. This will be sent to a lab to be tested.

Although babies and young children are particularly at risk from oral thrush, the condition can also affect adults. Read about oral thrush in adults.","If your GP or health visitor feels your baby needs treatment, your GP will probably prescribe an antifungal medicine.

If treatment hasn't fully cleared the thrush after treatment, speak to your GP or health visitor again for advice.","It's not clear whether it's possible to prevent oral thrush in babies. Some doctors suggest the following advice may help:

- sterilise dummies regularly, as well as any toys that your baby puts in their mouth
- sterilise bottles and other feeding equipment regularly, especially the teats

Washing your hands thoroughly after changing your baby's nappy can also be helpful in stopping thrush spreading. ",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/oral-thrush-babies
Prostatitis,"Prostatitis is the inflammation (swelling) of the prostate gland. It can be very painful, but will often get better eventually. Prostatitis can develop in men of all ages. It commonly affects men aged between 30 and 50. See your GP if you've any of the main symptoms of prostatitis.","There are two main types of prostatitis:
- acute prostatitis - symptoms are severe and develop suddenly; it's rare but it can be serious and requires immediate treatment; it's always caused by an infection 
- chronic prostatitis - symptoms come and go over a period of several months; it's the most common type; it's not usually caused by an infection

#Acute prostatitis
Symptoms of acute prostatitis include:
- pain, which may be severe, in or around your penis, testicles, anus, lower abdomen or lower back - passing stools (faeces) can be painful
- urinary symptoms, such as pain when peeing, needing to pee often (particularly at night), problems starting or ""stop-start"" peeing, an urgent need to pee and, sometimes, blood in your urine
- not being able to pee, which leads to a build-up of urine in the bladder known as acute urinary retention (AUR) - this needs urgent medical attention
- generally feeling unwell, with aches, pains and possibly a fever
- a small amount of thick fluid (discharge) may come out of your penis

See your GP if you have any of these symptoms. If you can’t see your GP and your symptoms are too severe to wait, contact your GP out of hours service.

#Chronic prostatitis
You may have chronic prostatitis if you've had the following symptoms for at least three months:
- pain in and around your penis, testicles, anus, lower abdomen, or lower back
- pain when peeing, a frequent or urgent need to pee, particularly at night, or ""stop-start"" peeing
- an enlarged or tender prostate on rectal examination, although in some cases it may be normal 
- sexual problems, such as erectile dysfunction, pain when ejaculating, or pelvic pain after sex

These symptoms can have a significant impact on your quality of life. However, in most cases, they'll gradually improve over time and with treatment.","Treatment for prostatitis will depend on whether you have acute or chronic prostatitis. The main treatment used is usually pain relieving medication and may include antibiotic treatment.

Treatment for chronic prostatitis aims to control the symptoms and reduce them so that they interfere less with day-to-day activities. Your GP will discuss your treatment with you.

A referral to your local pain clinic may also be considered if the symptoms are severe and not responding to treatment.","Risk factors for acute prostatitis include:
- having a urinary tract infection (UTI) in the recent past
- having an indwelling urinary catheter
- having a prostate biopsy
- having a sexually transmitted infection (STI)
- having HIV or AIDS
- having a problem with your urinary tract
- anal sex
i- njuring your pelvis

Risk factors for chronic prostatitis include:
- being middle-aged (30-50 years of age)
- having prostatitis in the past
- frequent urine infections
- If you have HIV or a problem with your immune system
- rarely it can occur as a result of a sexually transmitted infection",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/prostatitis#toc-3
Pulmonary embolism,"A pulmonary embolism is a blockage in the pulmonary artery. This is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs. This blockage, usually a blood clot, is potentially life-threatening. If your symptoms are severe, see below, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.","The symptoms of a pulmonary embolism can sometimes be difficult to recognise. This is because they can vary between individuals.

Symptoms can include:
- chest pain - a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in
- shortness of breath - which can come on suddenly or develop gradually
- coughing - this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood
- feeling faint, dizzy or passing out

You should visit your GP or GP out of hours services as soon as possible if you have a combination of the symptoms above.

If your symptoms are severe, dial 999 immediately and ask for an ambulance.",Pulmonary embolisms are treated with anticoagulant medicines. These stop the blood clot getting bigger while your body slowly reabsorbs it. They also reduce your risk of further clots developing.,"A number of methods may be recommended to prevent a pulmonary embolism if you're at risk of developing blood clots. These include:
- taking anticoagulant tablets, such as warfarin
- wearing compression stockings or using compression devices
- avoiding long periods of inactivity
- leading a healthy lifestyle, such as giving up smoking (if you smoke) and eating a healthy, balanced diet low in fat and including plenty of fruit and vegetables",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/pulmonary-embolism
Quinsy,"Quinsy, also known as a peritonsillar abscess, is a rare and potentially serious complication of tonsillitis. You should see your GP if you or your child have symptoms of quinsy, (see signs and symptoms section).

In quinsy, the abscess (a collection of pus) forms between one of your tonsils and the wall of your throat. This can happen when a bacterial infection spreads from an infected tonsil to the surrounding area.

Quinsy can occur at any age, but most commonly affects teenagers and young adults. It's possible to get it more than once.","Symptoms of quinsy can include:
- a severe and quickly worsening sore throat, usually on one side
- swelling inside the mouth and throat
- difficulty opening your mouth
- pain when swallowing
- difficulty swallowing, which may cause you to drool
- changes to your voice or difficulty speaking
- bad breath
- earache on the affected side
- headache and feeling generally unwell
- difficulty breathing

Some people with quinsy may also have a high temperature (fever), although this sometimes passes before the abscess develops.","People with quinsy usually need to be treated in hospital. Depending on how severe the infection is, you may need to stay in hospital for a few days and rest at home for a week or two afterwards.

#Medication
You will be given antibiotics to clear the infection. These will usually be given directly into a vein (intravenously) at first, but you may switch to a short course of tablets or capsules once you are well enough leave hospital.

Painkillers, such as paracetamol and ibuprofen, will be given to help ease any pain. You can continue to take these while you recover at home if necessary.

Occasionally, corticosteroid medication may also be used to help reduce the swelling in your throat.

#Surgery and procedures
In many cases, antibiotics alone are not effective, and it may be necessary to drain the pus from the abscess. This can be done by:
- needle aspiration - a long, fine needle is used to draw out the pus
- incision and drainage - a small cut (incision) is made over the affected area to drain the pus
- a tonsillectomy - an operation to remove your tonsils (this is rarely necessary while you have quinsy, but is often recommended at least six weeks after you’ve recovered)

You will often stay awake during a needle aspiration or incision and drainage procedure, but you will be given either a sedative to help you relax and/or a local anaesthetic to numb the area being treated.

Tonsillectomies and some incision and drainage procedures are carried out under general anaesthetic. This means you will be asleep and won't feel any pain while these procedures are carried out.","One of the best ways to prevent quinsy is to reduce your risk of developing tonsillitis.

You can help do this by:
- avoiding close contact with people who have viral or bacterial infections that cause tonsillitis
- regularly washing your hands with soap and warm water  
- not sharing glasses or utensils with people who are ill

Smoking may increase your risk of quinsy, so stopping smoking may reduce your chances of getting it.

Using antibiotics to treat viral tonsillitis doesn't significantly reduce the risk of quinsy and isn't routinely recommended.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/quinsy#toc-3
Reactive arthritis,"Reactive arthritis is a condition that causes redness and swelling (inflammation) in various joints in the body, especially the knees, feet, toes, hips and ankles.

Reactive arthritis usually develops after you've had an infection, particularly a sexually transmitted infection or food poisoning.

In most cases, it clears up within a few months and causes no long-term problems.

Men and women of any age can get it. But the condition is more common in men, and people aged between 20 and 40.","The symptoms of reactive arthritis usually develop shortly after you get an infection, such as a sexually transmitted infection or bowel infection.

The main, and sometimes only, symptom of reactive arthritis is pain, stiffness and swelling in the joints and tendons.

It can also affect the:
- genital tract
- eyes

Not everyone will get symptoms in these areas.

You should see your GP as soon as possible if you have any of these symptoms. This is especially if you have recently had diarrhoea or problems peeing.

#Joint symptoms
Reactive arthritis can affect any joints. But it's most common in the knees, feet, toes, hips and ankles.

Symptoms include:
- pain, tenderness and swelling in your joints
- pain and tenderness in some tendons, especially at the heels
- pain in your lower back and buttocks
- sausage-like swelling of your fingers and toes
- joint stiffness - particularly in the morning

#Genital tract symptoms
Sometimes, you can also have symptoms of a urinary tract infection. These include:
- needing to pee suddenly, or more often than usual
- pain or a burning sensation when peeing
- smelly or cloudy pee
- blood in your pee
- pain in your lower tummy
- feeling tired and unwell

#Eye symptoms
Occasionally, you may get inflammation of the eyes (conjunctivitis or, rarely, iritis).

Symptoms can include:
- red eyes
- watery eyes
- eye pain
- swollen eyelids
- sensitivity to light

See an eye specialist or go to your nearest emergency department as soon as possible if one of your eyes becomes very painful and the vision becomes misty.

This could be a symptom of iritis - and the sooner you get treatment, the more successful it is likely to be.

#Other symptoms
Reactive arthritis can also cause:
- flu-like symptoms
- a high temperature (fever)
- weight loss
- mouth ulcers
- a scaly rash on the hands or feet","Treatment usually focuses on:

- using antibiotics to clear any STI that may have triggered the reactive arthritis
- using painkillers such as ibuprofen to relieve joint pain and stiffness
- managing any severe or ongoing arthritis, usually using medications such as steroids or disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs)

Most people start returning to normal activities after 3 to 6 months. Symptoms don't usually last longer than 12 months.","Typically, reactive arthritis is caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), such as chlamydia, or an infection of the bowel, such as food poisoning.

You may also develop reactive arthritis if you, or someone close to you, has recently had glandular fever or slapped cheek syndrome.

The body's immune system seems to overreact to the infection and starts attacking healthy tissue, causing it to become inflamed. But the exact reason for this is unknown.

People who have a gene called HLA-B27 are much more likely to develop reactive arthritis than those who don't, but it's unclear why.

If your GP thinks you have reactive arthritis, they may refer you to an arthritis specialist (rheumatologist). They may also refer you to an eye specialist (ophthalmologist) if you have problems with your eyes.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/reactive-arthritis
Rett syndrome,"Rett syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that affects brain development, resulting in severe mental and physical disability. Some children with Rett syndrome are affected more severely than others. Also, the age at which symptoms first appear varies from child to child.","Rett syndrome is estimated to affect about 1 in 12,000 girls born each year. It is only rarely seen in boys. 

A child with Rett syndrome may not have every symptom listed below. Their symptoms can change as they get older.

Rett syndrome is described in four stages, although symptoms will often overlap between each stage. The main features of each stage are described below.

#Stage one: early signs
At first, the child will appear to develop and grow normally for at least six months. Although (especially with hindsight) there may be subtle signs of Rett syndrome before the child is recognised as having a problem.

Stage one is sometimes described as 'stagnation' because the child's development slows down or stops altogether. Symptoms include:
- low muscle tone (hypotonia)
- difficulty feeding
- unusual, repetitive hand movements or jerky limb movements
- delay with development of speech
- mobility problems, such as problems sitting, crawling and walking
- lack of interest in toys 

These symptoms typically begin during the period from six to 18 months of life. They often last for several months, although they can persist for a year or more.

Stage one can often go unnoticed by the child's parents and by healthcare professionals. This is because the changes occur gradually and may be subtle. 

#Stage two: regression
During stage two, known as 'regression' or the 'rapid destructive stage', the child starts to lose some of their abilities. This stage usually begins between the ages of one and four and may last for any time from two months to more than two years.

The child will gradually or suddenly start to develop severe problems with communication and language, memory, hand use, mobility, co-ordination and other brain functions. 

Some of the characteristics and behaviours are similar to those of autism spectrum disorder (ASD).

Signs at this stage include:

- loss of the ability to use the hands purposefully - repetitive hand movements are often difficult to control and include wringing, washing, clapping or tapping
- periods of distress, irritability and sometimes screaming for no obvious reason
- social withdrawal - a loss of interest in people and avoidance of eye contact
- unsteadiness and awkwardness when walking
- problems sleeping
- slowing of head growth
- difficulty eating, chewing or swallowing, and sometimes constipation that may cause tummy aches

Later on during regression, the child may experience periods of rapid breathing (hyperventilation) or slow breathing, including breath-holding. They may also swallow air which can lead to abdominal bloating.

#Stage three: plateau
Stage three of Rett syndrome can begin as early as two years of age or as late as 10 years of age. It often lasts for many years, with many girls remaining in this stage for most of their lives.

During stage three, some of the problems that occurred at stage two may get better - for example, there may be improvements in behaviour, with less irritability and crying.

The child may become more interested in people and their surroundings. There may be improvements in alertness, attention span and communication.

Their walking ability may also improve (or they may learn to walk, if they were previously unable to do so).

On the downside, problems that can arise during stage three include:
- seizures, which become more common
- irregular breathing patterns may get worse - for example, shallow breathing followed by rapid, deep breathing, or breath holding
- teeth grinding
- some children may develop heart rhythm abnormalities (arrhythmias)

Gaining and maintaining weight can also be difficult to achieve.

#Stage four: deterioration in movement
Stage four can last for years or even decades. The main symptoms at this stage are:

- development of a spinal curve (the spine bending to the left or right side), known as scoliosis
- muscle weakness and spasticity (abnormal stiffness, particularly in the legs)
- losing the ability to walk

Communication, language skills and brain function don't tend to get any worse during stage four. The repetitive hand movements may decrease and eye gaze usually improves.

Seizures also usually become less of a problem during adolescence and early adult life, although they will often be a lifelong problem to manage.","There's no cure for Rett syndrome. Treatment focuses on managing the symptoms.

As a parent caring for a child with the syndrome, it's likely you'll need help and support from a wide range of healthcare professionals.

The healthcare professionals may include specialist doctors, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists.","Almost all cases of Rett syndrome are caused by a mutation (a change in the DNA) in the MECP2 gene, which is found on the X chromosome (one of the sex chromosomes).

There's usually no family history of Rett syndrome. This means it isn't passed on from one generation to the next.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/rett-syndrome#toc-2
Sarcoidosis,"Sarcoidosis is a rare condition that causes small patches of red, swollen tissue (granulomas) to develop in the body's organs, usually the lungs and skin. It can affect people of all ages but usually develops aged between 20 and 40. It’s more common in women and people of African descent.","There are two types of sarcoidosis.

They are:
- acute sarcoidosis - symptoms develop suddenly, but usually clear within a few months or years and the condition doesn't come back
- chronic sarcoidosis - symptoms develop gradually and get worse over time, to the point where they become severe (lots of granulomas may form in an organ and prevent it from working properly)

The symptoms of sarcoidosis depend on which organs are affected, but typically include:
- tender, red bumps on the skin
- shortness of breath
- a persistent cough

It's impossible to predict how sarcoidosis will affect a person. The condition can affect any organ and the symptoms vary widely depending on which organs are involved.

Sarcoidosis most often affects:
- the lungs
- skin
- lymph nodes (glands)

Some of the typical symptoms are listed below.

#Lung symptoms
The lungs are affected in about 90 per cent of people with sarcoidosis. This is known as pulmonary sarcoidosis. The two main symptoms are shortness of breath and a persistent dry cough. Some people with pulmonary sarcoidosis experience pain and discomfort in their chest, but this is uncommon.

#Skin symptoms
The skin is affected in about 25 per cent of people with sarcoidosis. This can cause tender, red bumps or patches to develop on the skin (particularly the shins) and rashes on the upper body.

#Other symptoms
If other organs are affected, you may have some of the following symptoms:
- tender and swollen glands in the face, neck, armpits or groin
- tiredness and a general feeling of being unwell
- painful joints
- red or sore eyes
- an abnormal heart rhythm
- a blocked or stuffy nose
- pain in the bones
- kidney stones
- headache","Most people with sarcoidosis don't need treatment as the condition often goes away on its own, usually within a few months or years.

Simple lifestyle changes and over-the-counter painkillers (such as paracetamol or ibuprofen) are often all that's needed to control the pain of any flare-ups.

Doctors will monitor your condition to check if it's getting any better or worse without treatment.

This can be done with:
- regular X-rays
- breathing tests
- blood tests

If you require treatment your doctor will recommend the best option for you based on your situation.","It's thought that sarcoidosis happens because the immune system starts to attack its own tissues and organs. The resulting inflammation then causes granulomas, (granulated areas of inflammation in tissue) to develop in the organs.

Similar conditions include:
- rheumatoid arthritis
- lupus
These are collectively known as autoimmune conditions.

It's possible that some environmental factors may trigger the condition in people who are already genetically susceptible to it.

Sarcoidosis can occasionally occur in more than one family member. There's no evidence that the condition is inherited. The condition isn't infectious, so it can't be passed from person to person.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/sarcoidosis
Schizophrenia,"Schizophrenia is a severe long-term mental health condition. It changes how a person thinks and behaves. If you're experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, see your GP as soon as possible. If you're concerned about someone you know, you could contact their GP.","Doctors often describe schizophrenia as a type of psychosis. This means the person may not always be able to distinguish their own thoughts and ideas from reality.

Symptoms of schizophrenia include: 
- hallucinations - hearing or seeing things that don't exist
- delusions - where a person has an unshakeable belief in something untrue
- muddled thoughts that don’t appear to link or make sense
- changes in behaviour

Some people think schizophrenia causes a ’split personality’. This is not true.

Some people think that all people who suffer schizophrenia are violent and dangerous. This is not true. The cause of any violent behaviour is usually drug or alcohol misuse.","Schizophrenia is usually treated with a combination of medication and therapy tailored to each individual. In most cases, this will be antipsychotic medicines and cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).

People with schizophrenia usually receive help from a community mental health team, which offers day-to-day support and treatment.

Many people recover from schizophrenia, although they may have periods when symptoms return (relapses). Support and treatment can help reduce the impact the condition has on daily life.","The exact cause of schizophrenia is unknown. Most experts believe the condition is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

It's thought that some people are more vulnerable to developing schizophrenia, and certain situations can trigger the condition.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/schizophrenia
Severe head injury,Severe head injuries require immediate medical attention because there could be a risk of serious brain damage. Dial 999 immediately to request an ambulance if you're with someone who experiences any of symptoms highlighted below after sustaining a head injury.,"Symptoms can include:
- unconsciousness - where a person has collapsed and is unresponsive, even for a brief period of time
- concussion - a sudden but short-lived loss of mental function that occurs after a blow or other injury to the head; a person with concussion may have a glazed look or appear confused, but won’t necessarily be unconscious 
- fits or seizures 
- difficulty speaking or staying awake
- problems with the senses - such as hearing loss or double vision
- repeated episodes of vomiting (more than once in an adult and three or more times in a child)
- blood or clear fluid coming from the ears or nose
- memory loss (amnesia)
- sudden swelling or bruising around both eyes or behind the ear
- difficulty with walking or co-ordination","Severe head injuries always require hospital treatment. This may involve:
- observing the person  for any changes in their condition
- running tests to check for further damage
- treating the head injury, and any other injuries
- breathing support (ventilation) or brain surgery

Most people are able to go home within 48 hours. However, a small number of those admitted to hospital require skull or brain surgery.

When you're discharged from hospital, your doctor will advise you on the best way to help your recovery when you return home.

A particularly severe head injury can be fatal, so a person with this type of injury will be closely monitored in hospital, so that any complications that arise can be dealt with quickly and effectively.","It can be difficult to predict or avoid a head injury, but there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of serious injury. These include:
- ensuring your home (or those of elderly relatives) are free of trip hazards that could cause a fall, such as loose carpets or unnecessary items on the floor
- ‘childproofing’ your home - for example, by ensuring young children can’t reach windows or balconies
- using the right safety equipment for work, sport and DIY

Wearing a safety helmet during certain activities, such as skiing or cycling, may also help to prevent a serious head injury.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/severe-head-injury
Teeth grinding,"Teeth grinding and jaw clenching is often related to stress or anxiety. It doesn't always cause symptoms. Some people get facial pain and headaches. It can wear down your teeth over time. See your dentist to check for signs of grinding. See your GP if you think it’s also stress-related.

Most people who grind their teeth and clench their jaw aren't aware they're doing it.

It often happens during sleep or while concentrating or under stress.

#Teeth grinding in children
Teeth grinding can also affect children. It tends to happen after their baby teeth or adult teeth first appear. It usually stops after the adult teeth are fully formed.

See your GP if you're concerned about your child's teeth grinding. This is particularly if it's affecting their sleep.","Symptoms of teeth grinding include:
- facial pain
- headaches
- earache
- pain and stiffness in the jaw joint (temporomandibular joint) and surrounding muscles, which can lead to temporomandibular disorder (TMD)
- disrupted sleep (for you or your partner) 
- worn-down teeth, which can lead to increased sensitivity and even tooth loss
- broken teeth or fillings

Facial pain and headaches often disappear when you stop grinding your teeth. Tooth damage usually only occurs in severe cases and may need treatment.","There are a number of treatments for teeth grinding.

Using a mouth guard or mouth splint reduces the sensation of clenching or grinding your teeth. They also help reduce pain and prevent tooth wear. It can also help to protect against further damage.

Other treatments include muscle-relaxation exercises and sleep hygiene.

If you have stress or anxiety, treatment for this may be recommended.","The cause of teeth grinding isn't always clear. It's usually linked to other factors, such as stress, anxiety or sleep problems.

#Stress and anxiety
Teeth grinding is most often caused by stress or anxiety. Many people aren't aware they do it. It often happens during sleep. 

#Medication
Teeth grinding can sometimes be a side effect of taking certain types of medication.

In particular, teeth grinding is sometimes linked to a type of antidepressant known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Check with your pharmacist or GP if you think prescribed medication may be causing you to have symptoms.

#Sleep disorders
If you snore or have a sleep disorder, such as obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), you're more likely to grind your teeth while you sleep. OSA interrupts your breathing while you sleep.

You're also more likely to grind your teeth if you:
- talk or mumble while asleep
- behave violently while asleep, such as kicking out or punching
- have sleep paralysis (a temporary inability to move or speak while waking up or falling asleep)
- experience hallucinations (seeing or hearing things that aren't real) while semi-conscious

#Lifestyle
Other factors that can make you more likely to grind your teeth or make it worse include:
- drinking alcohol
- smoking
- using recreational drugs, such as ecstasy and cocaine
- having lots of caffeinated drinks, such as tea or coffee (six or more cups a day)",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/teeth-grinding
Thalassaemia,"Thalassaemia is the name for a group of inherited conditions that affect haemoglobin production. People with the condition produce either no or too little haemoglobin, which is used by red blood cells to carry oxygen around the body. This can make them very anaemic (tired, short of breath and pale).

Thalassaemia mainly affects people of Mediterranean, South Asian, Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin.

There are a number of types of thalassaemia, which can be divided into alpha and beta thalassaemias.

Beta thalassaemia major is the most severe type. Other types include beta thalassaemia intermedia, alpha thalassaemia major and haemoglobin H disease.

It's also possible to be a ""carrier"" of thalassaemia, also known as having the thalassaemia trait.

Thalassaemia carriers don't have any serious health problems themselves, but are at risk of having children with the condition.

Some types of thalassaemia may be picked up during newborn blood spot screening (heel prick test) - although this is rare in Northern Ireland.","Thalassaemia can cause a wide range of problems. Treatment can help keep many of these problems under control.

Children born with the main type of thalassaemia - beta thalassaemia major - usually develop symptoms a few months after birth.

Less severe types may not cause any noticeable problems until later in childhood or even until adulthood.

If you're a carrier of thalassaemia, you'll usually be healthy and won't have any symptoms.

If you have thalassaemia, you may have some of these symptoms:

#Anaemia
Almost everyone with thalassaemia major or other serious types will develop anaemia, which can be life-threatening in severe cases.

In anaemia there are low levels of haemoglobin (a substance that transports oxygen) in the blood.

It typically causes:
- tiredness (fatigue) and a general lack of energy 
- shortness of breath
- noticeably pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeats (palpitations)
- pale skin
- yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)

Frequent blood transfusions will usually be needed for life to stop anaemia becoming severe.

#Excess iron levels
Most people with thalassaemia major or other severe types will also be at risk of developing a range of problems caused by a build-up of iron in the body. It's usually a side effect of repeated blood transfusions,

Too much iron in the body can cause:
- heart problems - including problems affecting the heart muscle (cardiomyopathy), an irregular heartbeat and heart failure
- swelling and scarring of the liver (cirrhosis)
- early or delayed puberty
- low levels of oestrogen (female hormone) or testosterone (male hormone)
- diabetes
- problems with the thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) and parathyroid glands (hypoparathyroidism)

Lifelong treatment with medication to stop iron building up to harmful levels will usually be needed. This is known as chelation therapy.

#Other problems
Thalassaemia major or other severe types can also sometimes cause a number of other problems, including:
- delayed growth during childhood
- gallstones (small stones in the gallbladder), which can cause inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), tummy (abdominal) pain and jaundice
- unusual bone growth, such as an enlarged forehead or cheeks
- weak, fragile bones (osteoporosis)
- reduced fertility - some people with thalassaemia may need fertility treatment to help them have children","People with thalassaemia major or other serious types will need specialist care throughout their lives.

The main treatments are:

blood transfusions - regular blood transfusions are given to treat and prevent anaemia; in severe cases these are needed around once a month
chelation therapy - treatment with medications to remove the excess iron from the body that builds up as a result of having regular blood transfusions (some people experience a build-up of iron even without transfusions and need treatment for this)
Eating a healthy diet, doing regular exercise and not smoking or drinking too much alcohol can also help to make sure you stay as healthy as possible.

The only possible cure for thalassaemia is a stem cell or bone marrow transplant. But this isn't done very often because of the significant risks involved.","Thalassaemia is caused by faulty genes that affect the production of haemoglobin.

A child can only be born with the condition if they inherit these faulty genes from both parents.

For example, if both parents have the faulty gene that causes beta thalassaemia major, there's a 25 per cent chance of each child they have being born with the condition.

The parents of a child with the condition are usually carriers of thalassaemia. This means they only have one of the faulty genes that causes the condition.",FALSE,nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/thalassaemia
Underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism),"An underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) means your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. The thyroid gland is a small butterfly-shaped gland in the neck, just in front of the windpipe (trachea). Both men and women can have an underactive thyroid, although it's more common in women than in men.","The function of the thyroid gland is to produce hormones. These hormones help regulate the body's metabolism (the process that turns food into energy). 

Many symptoms of an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) are the same as those of other conditions. So an underactive thyroid can easily be confused for something else.

Symptoms usually develop slowly. You may not realise you have a medical problem for several years.

Common symptoms and signs include:
- tiredness
- being sensitive to cold
- weight gain
- constipation
- depression
- slow movements and thoughts
- hoarseness or deepening of the voice
- muscle aches and weakness
- muscle cramps
- ‘pins and needles’ sensation in the hands
- dry and scaly skin
- brittle hair and nails
- reduced body and scalp hair (for example sparse eyebrows)
- puffy face, hands and feet (myxoedema)
- loss of libido (sex drive)
- pain, numbness and a tingling sensation in the hand and fingers (carpal tunnel syndrome)
- irregular periods or heavy periods

Elderly people with an underactive thyroid may develop memory problems and depression. Children may experience slower growth and development. Teenagers may start puberty earlier than normal.

If you have any of these symptoms, see your GP and ask to be tested for an underactive thyroid.","An underactive thyroid can often be successfully treated by taking daily hormone tablets to replace the hormones your thyroid isn't making.

These hormone replacement tablets are called levothyroxine and  raise your thyroxine levels.

You'll usually need treatment for the rest of your life. However, with proper treatment, you should be able to lead a normal, healthy life.

If an underactive thyroid isn't treated, it can lead to complications, including:
- heart disease
- goitre (swelling of the thyroid gland that causes a lump to form in the throat)
- pregnancy problems
- a life-threatening condition called myxoedema coma (although this is very rare)","There's no way of preventing an underactive thyroid. 

An underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) is when your thyroid gland doesn't produce enough of the hormone thyroxine (also called T4).

Most cases of an underactive thyroid are caused by the immune system attacking the thyroid gland and damaging it.

Thyroid damage can also occur after thyroid or other neck surgery, or external radiotherapy for cancer treatment.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/underactive-thyroid-hypothyroidism#toc-0
Urinary incontinence,Urinary incontinence is the unintentional passing of urine (pee). It's a common problem. Health Trusts in Northern Ireland provide services to the public for help and support with incontinence issues. Seeking help can be the first step towards finding a way to manage the condition.,"Having urinary incontinence means you pass urine (pee) when you don’t want to.

When and how this happens depends on the type of urinary incontinence you have.

There are several types of the condition, including:
- stress incontinence - when urine leaks out at times when your bladder is under pressure; for example, when you cough or laugh
- urge incontinence - when urine leaks as you feel a sudden, intense urge to pass urine, or soon afterwards
- overflow incontinence (chronic urinary retention) - when you're unable to fully empty your bladder, which causes frequent leaking
- total incontinence - when your bladder can't store any urine at all, which causes you to pass urine constantly or have frequent leaking

It's also possible to have a mixture of both stress and urge urinary incontinence.","Your GP may suggest some simple measures to see if they help improve your symptoms.

These may include:
- lifestyle changes - such as losing weight and cutting down on caffeine and alcohol
- pelvic floor exercises - exercising your pelvic floor muscles by squeezing them, taught by a specialist
- bladder training - where you learn ways to wait longer between needing to urinate and passing urine, helped by a specialist

Using incontinence products, such as absorbent pads and handheld urinals can also be a help

Medication may be recommended if you're still unable to manage your symptoms.

Surgery may also be considered. The health professional looking after your care will discuss treatment for you.","It's not always possible to prevent urinary incontinence. But there are some steps you can take that may help reduce the chance of it developing.

These include:
- controlling your weight
- avoiding or cutting down on alcohol
- keeping fit - in particular, ensuring that your pelvic floor muscles are strong

#Healthy weight
Being obese can increase your risk of developing urinary incontinence. You may therefore be able to lower your risk by maintaining a healthy weight through regular exercise and healthy eating.

Use the healthy weight calculator(external link opens in a new window / tab) to see if you are a healthy weight for your height.

#Drinking habits
Depending on your particular bladder problem, your GP can advise you about the amount of fluids you should drink.

If you have urinary incontinence, cut down on alcohol and drinks containing caffeine, such as tea, coffee and cola. These can cause your kidneys to produce more urine and irritate your bladder.

The recommended weekly limits for alcohol intake are 14 units for men and women.

A unit of alcohol is roughly half a pint of normal-strength lager or a single measure (25ml) of spirits.

If you have to urinate often during the night, try drinking less in the hours before you go to bed. You should make sure you still drink enough fluids during the day.

#Pelvic floor exercises
Being pregnant and giving birth can weaken the muscles that control the flow of urine from your bladder. If you're pregnant, strengthening your pelvic floor muscles may help prevent urinary incontinence.

Men may also benefit from strengthening their pelvic floor muscles with pelvic floor exercises.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/urinary-incontinence#toc-0
Vaginal cancer,"Vaginal cancer is cancer that affects the vagina. Some types of cancer, such as cervical cancer, can spread to the vagina. This page is about cancer that begins in the vagina.","A total of 4 in every 5 women with vaginal cancer will have one or more of the following symptoms:
- vaginal bleeding after the menopause
- bleeding after sex or pain during sex
- smelly or bloodstained vaginal discharge
- bleeding between periods
- a lump or itch in your vagina that won't go away
- pain when peeing, or needing to pee a lot

Vaginal cancer is rare, especially in women under 40.

If you have these symptoms, it's much more likely you have something less serious, such as an infection.","You'll see a team of specialists who will recommend the best treatment for you. This will depend on things like how far the cancer has spread.

The main treatments for vaginal cancer are:
- radiotherapy- radiation from an external machine or a temporary implant in your vagina is used to kill cancer cells
- surgery - this may involve just removing a small part of your vagina or it could mean your vagina needs to be removed and recreated, and nearby tissue like your womb may need to be removed (hysterectomy)
- chemotherapy - medicine is used to relieve symptoms and kill cancer cells if they've spread to other parts of your body

Ask your care team about what the different treatments involve and why they think a certain treatment is best for you.","Like cervical cancer, vaginal cancer is usually caused by infection with some types of the human papilloma virus (HPV).

The HPV vaccination, now routinely offered to 11to 13-year-old girls, helps prevent infection with the main types of HPV linked to cervical and vaginal cancer.

This can significantly reduce the risk of getting these cancers later in life.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/vaginal-cancer#toc-5
Vaginal thrush,"Vaginal thrush is a common yeast infection that affects most women at some point. It may be unpleasant and uncomfortable. However, it can usually be treated with medication available from pharmacies or on prescription from your GP.","Typical symptoms of vaginal thrush include:
- itching and soreness around the entrance of the vagina (itchy labia)
- vaginal discharge - this is usually odourless and may be thick and white or thin and watery
- pain during sex, which may make you worry about having sex
- a stinging sensation when peeing

Sometimes the skin around the vagina can be red, swollen or cracked. Occasionally there may also be sores on the skin, although this is more often a sign of genital herpes.","Mild thrush can usually be treated with a short course of antifungal medication. The symptoms will usually clear up within a week or two.

However, for some women, vaginal thrush can be difficult to treat and keeps coming back. Treatment may need to be continued for longer if you have repeated bouts of thrush.

Several thrush medicines can be bought over the counter from pharmacies. Others are only available on prescription from your GP.

The main types are:
- pessaries - a special pill that you put into your vagina using a special applicator
- intravaginal creams - these are also placed into the vagina using an applicator
- capsules -these are swallowed and may be more convenient to use than pessaries or intravaginal cream, but can have more troublesome side effects, such as vomiting or an upset stomach

Your pharmacist or GP can help you decide which treatment will be best for you. Pregnant or breastfeeding women shouldn't take the capsules.

Care should be taken when using an applicator during pregnancy to avoid potential damage to the cervix. Some women prefer to put pessaries in by hand when pregnant.

You can also get creams to apply to the skin surrounding the entrance of your vagina. These can help relieve itchiness and soreness, although you may find that an ordinary moisturiser works just as well.","If you get thrush often, you can:
- use water and a moisturiser soap substitute to clean the skin around your vagina, but avoid cleaning this area more than once a day
- apply a greasier moisturiser to the skin around your vagina several times a day to protect it (but be aware that these moisturisers can weaken condoms)
- avoid potential irritants in perfumed soaps, shower gels, vaginal deodorants, wipes and douches
- avoid wearing tight-fitting underwear or tights - some women find that special silk underwear designed for people with eczema and thrush is helpful
- make sure your blood sugar level is kept under control, if you have diabetes",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/vaginal-thrush#toc-0
Vertigo,"Vertigo is a symptom, rather than a condition itself. It's the sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning. The sensation of moving or spinning makes vertigo different from simple dizziness.","The sensation that you, or the environment around you, is moving or spinning may be:
- barely noticeable
- so severe that you find it difficult to keep your balance and do everyday tasks

Attacks of vertigo can develop suddenly and last for a few seconds, or they may last much longer.

If you have severe vertigo, your symptoms may be constant and last for several days. This can make normal life difficult.

Other symptoms associated with vertigo may include:
- loss of balance - which can make it difficult to stand or walk
- feeling sick or being sick
- dizziness","Some cases of vertigo improve over time, without treatment. Some people have repeated episodes for many months, or even years, such as those with Ménière's disease.

There are specific treatments for some causes of vertigo. A series of simple head movements (known as the Epley manoeuvre) is used to treat BPPV.

If appropriate, your GP may prescribe medication. This can help in the early stages of most cases of vertigo.

If your symptoms are severe or not resolving your GP may refer you to an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist.

Many people with vertigo also benefit from referral for vestibular rehabilitation training (VRT), which is a series of exercises for people with dizziness and balance problems.  ","Vertigo is commonly caused by a problem with the way balance works in the inner ear. It can also be caused by problems in certain parts of the brain.

Causes of vertigo may include:
- benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV) - where certain head movements trigger vertigo
- migraines - severe headaches
- labyrinthitis - an inner ear infection
- vestibular neuronitis - inflammation of the vestibular nerve, which runs into the inner ear and sends messages to the brain that help to control balance
- Meniere's disease - thought to be caused by increased fluid pressure in the inner ear - it may occur as a result of viral or bacterial ear infections, or metabolic or immune disorders 

Much less common causes include:
- stroke and ‘mini stroke’ (transient ischaemic attack)
- brain (cerebellar) tumour
- acoustic neuroma
- multiple sclerosis

Depending on the condition causing vertigo, you may experience additional symptoms, such as a high temperature, ringing in your ears (tinnitus) and hearing loss.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/vertigo#toc-0
Von Willebrand disease,"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is a common inherited condition that can sometimes cause heavy bleeding. You should see your GP if you have symptoms of VWD, especially if someone else in your family has it, (see symptoms section below).","The symptoms of VWD may start at any age. They can range from very mild and barely noticeable to frequent and severe.

The main symptoms are:
- bruising easily or getting large bruises
- frequent or long-lasting nosebleeds
- bleeding gums
- heavy or long-lasting bleeding from cuts
- in women, heavy periods and bleeding during or after labour
- heavy or long-lasting bleeding after a tooth removal or surgery

In some people, there's also a small risk of problems such as bleeding in the gut (causing bleeding from the bottom) and painful bleeds into joints and muscles.","There's currently no cure for VWD. But the condition can usually be controlled with medicines and some simple lifestyle measures.

#Treating and preventing bleeds
If you have a bleed, applying pressure to the wound (or pinching the soft part of your nose if you have a nosebleed) for a few minutes may be all you need to do.

Your doctor may also give you medicine to help stop bleeding when it happens. If your doctor recommends medication, talk to them about the best option for you and ask about the side effects of each medicine.

These medicines can also be used before a procedure or operation to reduce the risk of bleeding. People with severe VWD may need to take them regularly to help prevent serious bleeds.

#Treatments for heavy periods
If you have heavy periods as a result of VWD, speak to your GP or specialist about treatments to help control the bleeding.

They will discuss with you the most treatment options with you.

#General advice
If you have VWD, it's a good idea to:
- tell your surgeon or dentist about your VWD if you're due to have a procedure or operation - you may need to take medication to reduce the risk of bleeding before and afterwards
- tell your doctor or nurse about your VWD if you need a vaccination - they can give the injection just under your skin to avoid painful bleeding in your muscles 
- avoid aspirin and anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen unless your specialist advises you it's safe to use them, as these can make bleeding worse - use other medicines such as paracetamol instead
- ask your specialist if there are any activities you need to avoid - you should be able to take part in most sports and activities, but it's best to check first","People with VWD have a low level of a substance called von Willebrand factor in their blood, or this substance doesn't work very well.

Von Willebrand factor helps blood cells stick together (clot) when you bleed. If there isn't enough of it or it doesn't work properly, it takes longer for bleeding to stop.

There's currently no cure for VWD. But the condition doesn't usually cause serious problems and most people with it can live normal, active lives.

VWD is often caused by a fault in the gene involved in the production of von Willebrand factor.

The type of VWD a person is born with mostly depends on whether they inherit copies of this faulty gene from one or both parents.

Speak to your specialist if you have VWD and are thinking of having a baby. If you have a family history of VWD and think you might be affected, tests should ideally be done before getting pregnant.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/von-willebrand-disease#toc-5
Whiplash,"Whiplash injury is a type of neck injury caused by sudden movement of the head forwards, backwards or sideways.","Whiplash occurs when the soft tissues in the neck become stretched and damaged (sprained).

Whiplash will often get better within a few weeks or months. But for some people it can last longer and severely limit their activities.

Common symptoms of whiplash include:
- neck pain and tenderness
- neck stiffness and difficulty moving your head
- headaches 
- muscle spasms
- pain in the shoulders and arms

Less common symptoms include:
- pins and needles in your arms and hands 
- dizziness
- tiredness 
- memory loss
- poor concentration and irritability

It can take several hours for the symptoms to develop after you injure your neck. The symptoms are often worse the day after the injury. They may continue to get worse for several days.","Whiplash will usually get better on its own or after some basic treatment.

Treatments for whiplash include:
- keeping your neck mobile and continuing with your normal activities - using a neck brace or collar isn't recommended
- painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen - stronger painkillers are available on prescription if these don't help
- physiotherapy, exercises and stretches

If your pain lasts a long time, you may be referred to a specialist.

Painkilling injections and surgery aren't normally used for whiplash.","Whiplash can occur if the head is thrown forwards, backwards or sideways violently.

Common causes of whiplash include:
- road traffic accidents and collisions
- a sudden blow to the head - for example, during sports such as boxing or rugby
- a slip or fall where the head is suddenly jolted backwards
- being struck on the head by a heavy or solid object",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/whiplash#toc-3
Yellow fever,"Yellow fever is a serious infection spread by mosquitoes. It's found in parts of Africa, South America, Central America and the Caribbean. There's a vaccine that can stop you from getting it if you're travelling to an area where the infection is found.

- a headache
- feeling sick or vomiting
- muscle pain and backache 
- your eyes being sensitive to light
- loss of appetite and feeling generally unwell

Most people make a full recovery after three or four days.

- yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice)
- bleeding from the mouth, nose or eyes
- vomiting blood or blood in poo

Up to half of those who get these symptoms die.","There's no cure for yellow fever. But the symptoms can be treated while your body fights off the infection.

Most people make a full recovery after three or four days.
