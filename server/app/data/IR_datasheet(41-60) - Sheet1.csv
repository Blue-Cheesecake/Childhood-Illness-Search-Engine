Abdominal aortic aneurysm,An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta. The aorta is the main blood vessel that supplies blood to your body. An AAA can be dangerous if it isn't spotted early on. Men aged 65 and over are most at risk of AAAs.,"AAAs don't usually cause any obvious symptoms. They are often only picked up during screening or tests carried out for another reason.

Some people with an AAA have:
- a pulsing sensation in the tummy (like a heartbeat)
- tummy pain that doesn't go away
- lower back pain that doesn't go away

If an AAA bursts, it can cause:
- sudden, severe pain in the tummy or lower back
- dizziness
- sweaty, pale and clammy skin
- a fast heartbeat
- shortness of breath
- fainting or passing out","The recommended treatment for an AAA depends on how big it is.

Treatment isn't always needed straight away if the risk of an AAA bursting is low.

Treatment for a:
- small AAA (3cm to 4.4cm across) - ultrasound scans are recommended every year to check if it's getting bigger; you'll be advised about healthy lifestyle changes to help stop it growing
- medium AAA (4.5cm to 5.4cm) - ultrasound scans are recommended every three months to check if it's getting bigger; you'll also be advised about healthy lifestyle changes
- large AAA (5.5cm or more) - surgery to stop it getting bigger or bursting is usually recommended

Ask your doctor if you're not sure what size your AAA is.","An AAA can form if the sides of the aorta weaken and balloon outwards. It's not always clear why this happens, but there are things that increase the risk.

People at a higher risk of getting an AAA include:

- men aged 65 or over - AAAs are up to six times more common in men than women, and the risk of getting one goes up as you get older
- people who smoke - if you smoke or used to smoke, you're up to 15 times more likely to get an AAA
- people with high blood pressure - high blood pressure can double your risk of getting an AAA
- people with a parent, sibling or child with an AAA - you're about four times more likely to get an AAA if a close relative has had one

Speak to your GP if you're worried you may be at risk of an AAA. They may suggest having a scan to check if you have one and making healthy lifestyle changes to reduce your risk of an AAA.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/abdominal-aortic-aneurysm
Abscess,"An abscess is a painful collection of pus, usually caused by a bacterial infection. Abscesses can develop anywhere in the body. See your GP if you think you may have one. They usually wonâ€™t get better without treatment.","The symptoms of an abscess depend on where it develops in your body.

#Skin abscesses
Signs of a skin abscess can include:
- a smooth swelling under your skin that can feel hard or firm
- pain and tenderness in the affected area
- warmth and redness in the affected area
- a visible build-up of white or yellow pus under the skin in the affected area
- a high temperature (fever)
- chills

A boil is a common example of a skin abscess.

#Internal abscesses
Abscesses that develop inside an organ or in the spaces between organs can be more difficult to identify than skin abscesses.

The symptoms can be vague. There may be no obvious external signs of a problem.

The symptoms of an internal abscess can also vary. This depends on exactly where in the body the abscess develops.

For example, a liver abscess may cause jaundice, while an abscess in or near the lungs may cause a cough or shortness of breath.

General symptoms of an internal abscess can include:
- discomfort in the area of the abscess
- fever
- increased sweating
- feeling sick
- vomiting
- chills
- pain or swelling in your tummy (abdomen)
- loss of appetite and weight loss
- extreme tiredness (fatigue)
- diarrhoea or constipation","A small skin abscess may drain naturally, or simply shrink, dry up and disappear without any treatment.

Larger abscesses may need to be treated with antibiotics to clear the infection. The pus may need to be drained.

This will usually be done either by inserting a needle through your skin or by making a small incision in the skin over the abscess.","Most skin abscesses are caused by bacteria getting into a minor wound, the root of a hair or a blocked oil or sweat gland.

Ensuring that your skin is clean, healthy and largely free of bacteria can help reduce the risk of skin abscesses developing.

You can reduce the risk of bacteria spreading by:
- washing your hands regularly
- encouraging people in your family to wash their hands regularly
- using separate towels and not sharing baths
- waiting until your skin abscess is fully treated and healed before using any communal equipment, such as gym equipment, saunas or swimming pools

Don't squeeze the pus out of the abscess yourself. This is because this can easily spread the bacteria to other areas of your skin.

If you use tissues to wipe any pus away from your abscess, dispose of them straight away to avoid germs spreading. Wash your hands after you've disposed of the tissues.

Take care when shaving your face, legs, underarm areas or bikini area to avoid nicking your skin. Clean any wounds immediately.

Don't share razors or toothbrushes.

It may also help to reduce your risk of skin abscesses by:
- maintaining a healthy, balanced diet 
- losing weight if you're overweight or obese
- stopping smoking

It's difficult to prevent internal abscesses, as they're often complications of other conditions.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/abscess
Acanthosis nigricans,"Acanthosis nigricans is the name for dry, dark patches of skin that usually appear in the armpits, neck or groin. It could be a sign of an underlying condition, so it needs to be checked by a GP.","The main symptom of acanthosis nigricans is patches of skin that are darker and thicker than usual. The patches often appear gradually without any other symptoms.

These patches:
- can appear anywhere on the body 
- are dry and feel similar to velvet
- are most common in skin folds, such as the armpits, neck or groin
- can have tiny growths on the patches
- can sometimes itch","Once your GP knows what's causing the condition, they can recommend the best treatment.

The skin patches should fade over time once the cause is treated.

If you're very overweight, your GP may recommend losing weight.

Depending on the cause, they may also recommend:
- medicine to balance your hormones
- medicine to balance your insulin levels
- changing your medicine to one that doesn't cause the patches

There's no specific treatment for the skin patches.

A skin specialist (dermatologist) may be able to suggest treatments to improve their appearance. But finding and treating the cause is usually recommended first.","The most common cause of acanthosis nigricans is being very overweight.

Other causes include:
- type 2 diabetes
- conditions that affect hormone levels - such as Cushing's syndrome, -polycystic ovary syndrome or an underactive thyroid
- taking certain medicines - including steroids or hormone treatments like the contraceptive pill
- in rare cases, cancer - usually stomach cancer
- in rare cases, a faulty gene inherited from your parents

Sometimes acanthosis nigricans happens in healthy people with no other conditions. This is more common in people with dark skin.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/acanthosis-nigricans
Achalasia,"Achalasia is a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus). This can make it difficult to swallow food and drink. Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life, (see symptoms section below). If your GP thinks you have achalasia, you will be referred to hospital for tests.

Normally, the muscles of the oesophagus contract to squeeze food along towards the stomach. A ring of muscle at the end of the food pipe then relaxes to let food into the stomach.

In achalasia, the muscles in the oesophagus don't contract correctly and the ring of muscle can fail to open properly, or doesn't open at all. Food and drink cannot pass into the stomach and becomes stuck. It is often brought back up.","Not everyone with achalasia will have symptoms.

But most people with achalasia will find it difficult to swallow food or drink (known as dysphagia). Swallowing tends to get gradually more difficult or painful over a couple of years, to the point where it is sometimes impossible.

Other symptoms include:
- bringing back up undigested food
- choking and coughing fits
- heartburn
- chest pain
- repeated chest infections
- drooling of vomit or saliva
- gradual but significant weight loss

Symptoms of achalasia may start at any time of life.

Long-term untreated achalasia very slightly increases the risk of developing cancer of the oesophagus. This means it is important to tell your GP if you have symptoms of achalasia, even if your symptoms are not bothering you. The earlier the condition is diagnosed and treated, the lower the risk.","There is no cure for achalasia, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms and make swallowing easier.

Your doctors will talk to you about the risks and benefits of the different treatment options. Treatment options include:

- medication - medicine can help to relax the muscles in your oesophagus - this makes swallowing easier and less painful for some people, although it doesn't work for everyone
- stretching the muscle (balloon dilation) - under a sedative or general anaesthetic, a balloon is passed into the oesophagus using a long, thin flexible tube (endoscope) - the balloon is then inflated to help stretch the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach
- Botox injection - using an endoscope, Botox is injected into the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach, causing it to relax - it is usually effective for a few months and occasionally for a few years, but it has to be repeated
- surgery - under general anaesthetic, the muscle fibres in the ring of muscle that lets food into your stomach are cut - it can permanently make swallowing easier

#Follow-up treatment
Balloon dilation and surgery can both cause side effects such as acid reflux and heartburn and chest pain. Your GP may be able to prescribe medication to help with this, and your surgeon may suggest you take this medication routinely.

It's normal for chest pain to persist for a while after treatment. Drinking cold water may help relieve this.

You should see your GP if you still have problems with swallowing or are continuing to lose weight after treatment.","Achalasia is thought to happen when the nerves in the oesophagus become damaged and stop working properly. This is why the muscles and ring of muscle don't work. The exact cause of this is unknown.

In some people, it may be linked to a viral infection. It may also be linked with having an autoimmune condition, where the body's immune system attacks healthy cells, tissue and organs.

In very rare cases, achalasia may run in families.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/achalasia
Acoustic neuroma (vestibular schwannoma),An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) nerve tumour. It's also known as a vestibular schwannoma. They are most common in adults aged 30-60. You should see your GP if you persistent symptoms like those of an acoustic neuroma (see symptoms section below).,"An acoustic neuroma may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.

Any symptoms tend to develop gradually and often include:
- hearing loss that usually only affects one ear
- tinnitus (hearing sounds that come from inside the body)
- vertigo (the sensation that you're moving or spinning)

A large acoustic neuroma can also sometimes cause:
- persistent headaches
- temporary blurred or double vision
- numbness, pain or weakness on one side of the face
- problems with limb co-ordination (ataxia) on one side of the body
- a hoarse voice or difficulty swallowing","There are several different treatment options for an acoustic neuroma, depending on the size and position of your tumour, how fast it's growing and your general health.

The main options are:
- monitoring the tumour with regular MRI scans
- brain surgery
- stereotactic radiosurgery

Speak to your specialist about the best option for you and what the benefits and risks of each option are.","An acoustic neuroma is a type of non-cancerous (benign) tumour that grows on a nerve close to the brain. A benign tumour is a growth that usually grows slowly over many years and doesn't spread to other parts of the body.

Acoustic neuromas grow on the nerve used for hearing and balance, causing problems such as hearing loss and unsteadiness. They can be serious if they become very large, but most are picked up and treated before they reach this stage.

Acoustic neuromas have no obvious cause, although a small number of cases are the result of a genetic condition called neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2).",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/acoustic-neuroma-vestibular-schwannoma
Actinic keratoses (solar keratoses),"Actinic keratoses (solar keratoses) are rough patches of skin caused by damage from years of sun exposure. They aren't usually a serious problem and can go away on their own. It's important to get them checked as there's a chance they might turn into skin cancer at some point.
Contents","Actinic keratoses usually appear on skin that's exposed to the sun.

Common places to get them are the:
- face
- forearms
- hands
- scalp
- ears
- lower legs

The patches can be:
- red, pink, brown or skin-coloured
- rough or scaly (like sandpaper)
- flat or stick out from the skin (similar to warts)
- a few millimetres to a few centimetres across
- sore or itchy","Talk to your GP about the treatment options for actinic keratoses.

Sometimes they may just suggest that you check the patches regularly and come back if they start to grow quickly, hurt or bleed.

If the patches cause problems (for example, they're unsightly or sore) or your doctor is concerned they could turn into cancer, they may suggest treatment or referral to a skin specialist.

The right treatment for you depends on how many patches you have, where they are and what they look like. Ask about the benefits and risks (such as side effects or scarring) of each option.","If you have actinic keratoses, it's very important to protect your skin from the sun.

This can reduce the risk of more patches appearing. It may also help reduce your risk of getting skin cancer.

To protect yourself from the sun:
- cover your skin with clothes and a hat during the summer months
- apply sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of at least 15 before going out into the sun
- try to stay inside or in the shade when the sun is at its strongest (between 11am and 3pm)

It may also help to use moisturising creams (emollients) on your skin every day to stop it becoming dry.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/actinic-keratoses-solar-keratoses
Acute cholecystitis,"Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually, but not always, occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious. It usually needs to be treated in hospital.
","Gallstones are small stones that form in the gallbladder. They are formed from bile. This is a substance stored in the gallbladder and released into the gut. It helps to digest the fats we eat in food.

Bile contains a mixture of salts, cholesterol and bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of red blood cells in the body.

Gallstones usually (but not always) develop when cholesterol levels in the bile are too high, and excess cholesterol turns into stones.

Gallstones are very common. They don't usually cause symptoms, but they can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis.

The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder.

Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent. The pain doesn't usually go away within a few hours.

Some people may have other symptoms, such as:
- a high temperature (fever)
- nausea and vomiting
- sweating
- loss of appetite
- yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
- a bulge in the abdomen","If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.

After initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused acute cholecystitis usually fall back into the gallbladder. The inflammation will often calm down.

#Surgery
Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment. This is to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring. This is also to reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. 

The consultant surgeon at the hospital will discuss with you whether surgery is the best option.

Although some people who've had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.

The organ is useful, but it's not essential.","It isn't always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis. You can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones.

One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet.  Also reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.

Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. Having a healthy diet and exercise regularly is important to help maintain good health.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD),"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common condition that affects the middle part of your vision. It usually first affects people in their 50s and 60s. It doesn't cause total blindness but it can make everyday activities, like reading, difficult. See an optician if you're worried about your vision.","The first symptom is often a blurred or distorted area in your vision. If it gets worse, you might struggle to see anything in the middle of your vision.

AMD can make some tasks difficult, like:
- reading
- watching TV
- driving
- recognising faces

Other symptoms include:
- seeing straight lines as wavy or crooked
- objects looking smaller than normal
- colours seeming less bright than they used to
- seeing things that aren't there (hallucinations)

AMD isn't painful and doesn't affect the appearance of your eyes. Sometimes AMD may be found during a routine eye test before you have symptoms.","Treatment depends on the type of AMD you have. The health professional looking after your care will recommend the best course of treatment for you depending on your diagnosis. Treatment for the types include:

- dry AMD - there's no treatment, but vision aids can help reduce the effect on your life

- wet AMD - you may need regular eye injections and, very occasionally, a light treatment called ""photodynamic therapy"" to stop your vision getting worse","AMD affects the middle part of your vision, not the edges (peripheral vision). You can get it in one eye or both.

The exact cause of AMD is unknown. It's been linked to:

Bad breath (halitosis),"Bad breath is a common problem that can affect anyone at any age. About one in four people are thought to have bad breath (halitosis) on a regular basis. Improving your oral hygiene is usually enough to cure bad breath and stop it happening again, (see â€˜preventing bad breathâ€™ below).","See your dentist, dental hygienist or dental therapist first if you still have bad breath after making changes to improve your dental hygiene.

You may also need to visit your GP as there may be a medical cause that needs to be investigated.

Don't try to hide the smell of your breath when seeking medical advice. This is because it may make it more difficult to find out what's causing the problem

It's not always easy to tell if you have bad breath. Other people may notice it first, but they could feel uncomfortable telling you.

A simple test to find out whether you have bad breath is to lick the inside of your wrist with the back of your tongue.

You should wait a few seconds until the saliva dries. If your wrist smells unpleasant, it's likely your breath does, too.","Improving your oral hygiene is usually enough to cure bad breath and stop it happening again.

To improve your oral health, make sure you:

floss between your teeth daily
brush your teeth and gums regularly
clean your tongue regularly
You should visit your dentist for regular check-ups. Having regular dental check-ups will make sure any plaque and calculus - previously known as tartar - is removed from your teeth, particularly in areas that are difficult to reach.

Your dentist can recommend the best way to clean your teeth and gums, and point out areas you might be missing. They can also identify any signs of gum disease and make sure early treatment.","There are a number of things that can cause bad breath. It's usually the result of poor oral hygiene. If bacteria build up in your mouth, the toxins produced can cause your breath to smell.

Bacteria break down pieces of food in the mouth, and may release an unpleasant-smelling gas. Any food trapped on your teeth - particularly between them - is broken down by bacteria. This may cause bad breath.

Persistent bad breath can sometimes be a sign of gum disease. Eating strongly flavoured foods, such as onions and garlic, can also cause your breath to smell.   Smoking and drinking alcohol can also cause your breath to smell.

Occasionally, bad breath can occur after an infection or illness, or as a result of taking certain types of medication.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/bad-breath-halitosis
Baker's cyst (popliteal cyst),"A Baker's cyst is a fluid-filled swelling that develops at the back of the knee. Itâ€™s caused when tissue behind the knee joint becomes swollen and inflamed.

- pain in the knee and calf
- a build-up of fluid around the knee
- occasional locking or clicking in the knee joint

Sometimes a Baker's cyst may not cause any symptoms other than the fluid-filled swelling at the back of the knee.

In rare cases, a Baker's cyst can burst (rupture), resulting in fluid leaking down into your calf. This can cause:
- sharp pain
- swelling and redness in your calf","Treatment won't usually be necessary if you have a Baker's cyst that isn't causing any symptoms.

Over-the-counter painkillers can be used to reduce the swelling of a Baker's cyst and relieve any pain. Bandages or an ice pack may also help. A bag of frozen peas wrapped in a tea towel works well as an ice pack.

If you have an underlying condition that's causing your cyst, it's important that the condition is properly managed. The cyst may disappear when the condition causing it has been treated.

In some cases, it may be possible to drain the cyst. Surgery may also be needed to repair any significant damage around the knee joint.

Find out more about Bakerâ€™s cyst on the NHS website","Knee damage caused by a sports-related injury or a blow to the knee can lead to a Baker's cyst developing.

A Baker's cyst can also sometimes occur if you have a health condition such as:
- osteoarthritis
- inflammatory arthritis - including rheumatoid arthritis
- gout

Cleft lip and palate,A cleft is a gap or split in the upper lip and/or roof of the mouth (palate). It is present from birth. The gap is there because parts of the baby's face didn't join together properly during development in the womb.,"Cleft lips are usually picked up during the mid-pregnancy anomaly scan carried out when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant.

Not all cleft lips will be obvious on this scan and it's very difficult to detect a cleft palate on a routine ultrasound scan.

If a cleft lip or palate doesn't show up on the scan, it's normally picked up immediately after birth or during the newborn physical examination done within 72 hours of giving birth.

When your child is diagnosed as having a cleft lip or palate, you'll be referred to a specialist for assessment and treatment. They will explain your child's condition, discuss the treatments they may need, and answer any questions you have.","Cleft lips and cleft palates are treated by a specialist at hospital.

Your child will usually have a long-term care plan. The plan outlines the treatments and assessments they're likely to need as they grow up.

The health professional looking after your childâ€™s care with discuss with you the treatment options for your child.

The main treatments are:
- surgery - surgery for a cleft lip is usually carried out at 3-6 months and an operation to repair a cleft palate is usually performed at 6-12 months
- feeding support - you may need advice about positioning your baby on your breast to help them feed, or you might need to feed them using a specially-designed bottle
- monitoring hearing - babies born with cleft palates have a higher chance of glue ear, which may affect hearing; close monitoring of their hearing is important and if glue ear affects their hearing significantly, a hearing aid may be fitted or small tubes called grommets may be placed in their ears to drain the fluid
- speech and language therapy - if your baby is born with a cleft affecting their palate (cleft palate or cleft lip and palate) a speech and language therapist will monitor your child's speech and language development throughout their childhood; they will help with any speech and language problems as necessary
- good dental hygiene and orthodontic treatment - you'll be given advice about looking after your child's teeth, and braces may be needed if their adult teeth don't come through properly","A cleft lip or palate happens when the structures that form the upper lip or palate fail to join together when a baby is developing in the womb.

The exact reason why this doesn't happen in some babies is often unclear.

In a few cases, cleft lip and palate is associated with:
- the genes a child inherits from their parents (although most cases are a one-off)
- smoking during pregnancy or drinking alcohol during pregnancy
- obesity during pregnancy
- a lack of folic acid during pregnancy
- taking certain medicines in early pregnancy, such as some anti-seizure medications and steroid tablets

In some cases, a cleft lip or palate can occur as part of a condition that causes a wider range of birth defects, such as 22q11 deletion syndrome (sometimes known as DiGeorge or velocardiofacial syndrome) and Pierre Robin sequence.

Cold sore (herpes simplex virus),"Cold sores are small blisters that develop on the lips or around the mouth. They're caused by the herpes simplex virus. Cold sores usually clear up without treatment within 10 to 14 days.

Cold sores that keep coming back (recurrent) are shorter and less severe than a first infection.

Most people with recurrent herpes lip infections have two or more outbreaks (episodes) per year.

 A minority of people can have six or more outbreaks per year. Infections in the mouth can be more severe and last two to three weeks. ","You may not have any symptoms when you first become infected with the virus (the primary infection). An outbreak of cold sores may occur some time later and keep coming back (recurrent infection).

If the primary infection does cause symptoms, they can be quite severe.

#Herpes simplex virus primary infection

##In children

Symptoms of the primary infection are most likely to develop in children younger than five years old. Symptoms include:
- swollen and irritated gums with small, painful sores in and around the mouth - this is known as herpes simplex gingivostomatitis
- sore throat and swollen glands
- producing more saliva than normal
- high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above
- dehydration
- feeling sick (nausea)
- headaches 

Herpes simplex gingivostomatitis usually affects young children, but adults can also develop it. It can last 10 to 14 days, with the sores taking up to three weeks to heal. Gingivostomatitis doesn't usually recur after the primary infection.

##In adults

Primary herpes simplex viruses are rare in adults. But the symptoms are similar to those experienced by children.

Symptoms include:
- you'll usually have a sore throat with or without swollen glands
- you may also have bad breath (halitosis) and painful sores in and around your mouth - these can develop into ulcers with grey or yellow centres

If you develop the herpes simplex virus at an early age, it may be triggered from time to time in later life. It can cause recurring bouts of cold sores. 

After the primary infection, the symptoms are usually reduced to just the cold sores themselves.","Recurrent cold sores usually clear up by themselves without treatment within 7 to 10 days.

Antiviral creams and other treatments are available over the counter from pharmacies without a prescription.

If used correctly, these can help ease your symptoms and speed up the healing time.

To be effective, these treatments should be applied as soon as the first signs of a cold sore appear. This is when you feel a tingling, itching or burning sensation around your mouth. Using an antiviral treatment after this initial period is unlikely to have much of an effect.

Ask your pharmacist if you need information about treatments for cold sores.

If your GP thinks it is necessary, antiviral tablets may be prescribed for severe cases.","The herpes simplex virus - or ""cold sore virus"" - is highly contagious. It can be easily passed from person to person by close direct contact.

After someone has contracted the virus, it remains inactive (dormant) most of the time.

It's not possible to prevent infection with the virus or prevent outbreaks of cold sores. But you can take steps to minimise the spread of infection.

Cold sores are at their most contagious when they burst (rupture). They stay contagious until they're completely healed. Avoid close contact with others until your cold sore has completely healed and disappeared.

There's no need to stay away from work or miss school if you or your child have a cold sore.

You can help minimise the risk of the cold sore virus spreading and cold sores recurring by:
- avoid touching cold sores unless you're applying cold sore cream - creams should be dabbed on gently rather than rubbed in, as this can damage your skin further
- always wash your hands before and after applying cold sore cream and after touching the affected area
- don't share cold sore creams or medication with other people as this can cause the infection to spread
- don't share items that come into contact with the affected area, such as lipsticks or cutlery
- avoid kissing and oral sex until your cold sores have completely healed
- be particularly careful around newborn babies, pregnant women and people with a low immune system, such as those with HIV or those having chemotherapy
- if you know what usually triggers your cold sores, try to avoid the triggers - for example, a sun block lip balm (SPF 15 or higher) may help prevent cold sores triggered by bright sunlight",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/cold-sore-herpes-simplex-virus
Dental abscess,"A dental abscess is a collection of pus that forms in your teeth or gums. It forms as the result of a bacterial infection. Anyone with teeth can develop a dental abscess, children and adults are equally affected.","The main symptom of a dental abscess is a severe, throbbing pain in your affected tooth or gum.

The pain usually:
- comes on suddenly
- may gradually get worse over a few hours or a few days
- causes teeth to be tender and sensitive

Sometimes the pain may spread to your ear, lower jaw and neck, on the same side as the affected tooth. There can also be severe swelling in the face, which can spread if the abscess is not treated.

Other symptoms can include:
- tenderness of your tooth and surrounding area
- sensitivity to very hot or cold food and drink
- an unpleasant taste in your mouth
- bad breath (halitosis)
- a general feeling of being unwell
- difficulty opening your mouth
- difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
- disturbed sleep 
- a high temperature (fever)","If you think you may have a dental abscess, you should see your dentist as soon as possible. Your GP can give you advice, but they cannot provide the treatment needed to cure an abscess.

Usually the only way to cure a dental abscess is with dental treatment.","The following symptoms may mean the infection has spread to other parts of your body:
- swelling in your face
- a high temperature (fever) of 38Â°C (100.4Â°F) or above
- severe pain that does not respond to treatment with painkillers
- breathing difficulties

If you develop any of these symptoms and you are not due to see a dentist straight away, you will need to access emergency dental services. Find information about emergency dental services in Northern Ireland.

Developmental co-ordination disorder (Dyspraxia),"Developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD), also known as dyspraxia, is a common disorder that affects movement and co-ordination. It doesnâ€™t affect intelligence, but it can make daily life more difficult. See your GP if you think you have undiagnosed symptoms (see below).","Symptoms of DCD can vary between individuals and may change over time. You may find routine tasks difficult, and coping at work may be hard.

If you have DCD you may have problems with:
- co-ordination, balance and movement
- learning new skills, thinking, and remembering information at work and in leisure activities
- daily living skills, such as dressing or preparing meals to time
- fine motor skills such as writing, typing, drawing and grasping small objects
- social situations
- dealing with your emotions
- time management, planning and personal organisation

DCD should not be confused with other disorders affecting movement, such as:
- cerebral palsy
- strokes

It can affect people of all intellectual abilities.","Although there is no cure for DCD, there are therapies that can help you cope with your condition and be successful in your studies, work and home life, such as:
- occupational therapy - to help you find practical ways to stay independent and manage everyday tasks such as writing or preparing food
- cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT)(external link opens in a new window / tab) - a talking therapy that can help you manage your problems by changing the way you think and behave
- It may also help if you:
- regular exercise can help with co-ordination, reduce feelings of fatigue and prevent you gaining weight
- learn how to use a computer or laptop if writing by hand is difficult
- use a calendar or diary to improve your organisation - you may be able to synchronise this with your phone and computer
- learn how to talk positively about your challenges and how you have overcome them
- seek out employment support

#Support for people living with DCD
DCD can have a big effect on your life, but support is available to help you manage your condition and have the best possible quality of living.

It might help to speak to others who have the same condition or to connect with a charity."," Itâ€™s not known what causes DCD, but you may be at a higher risk of developing it if you were born prematurely. DCD is more common in men and often runs in families.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/developmental-co-ordination-disorder-dyspraxia#toc-0
Embolism,"An embolism is a blockage in an artery, caused by a foreign body, such as a blood clot. The blood supply to that part of the body is stopped, causing it to lose some or all function. Dial 999 if you think you or someone else has an embolism.","Two of the most serious conditions caused by an embolism are:
- stroke - where the blood supply to the brain is cut off
- pulmonary embolism - where a foreign body blocks the artery that carries blood from the heart to the lungs (the pulmonary artery)

The main symptoms of a stroke are:
- drooping of the face
- weakness or numbness in one arm
- slurred speech or an inability to talk at all

The main symptoms of a pulmonary embolism are:
- chest pain - a sharp, stabbing pain that may be worse when you breathe in
- shortness of breath - which can come on suddenly or develop gradually
- coughing - this is usually dry, but may include coughing up blood or mucus that contains blood
- feeling faint, dizzy or passing out

Deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in the deep veins of your leg, is one of the main causes of pulmonary embolisms. Sometimes it doesn't cause any symptoms. Symptoms can include:
- pain, swelling and tenderness in one of your legs (usually your calf)
- a heavy ache in the affected area
- warm skin in the area of the clot
- red skin, particularly at the back of your leg below the knee

If an artery in a limb is blocked, it causes critical limb ischaemia with the following symptoms:
- pain
- discoloured skin (either pale or blue)
- coldness
- loss of movement","How an embolism is treated will depend on:
- what caused the blockage
- the size of the blockage
- where the blockage is in the body 

A surgical procedure called an embolectomy is sometimes carried out to remove an obstruction.

Medication may be used to dissolve embolisms (thrombolysis) caused by blood clots. Anticoagulant medication can help make the blood less sticky and stop further clots forming.

Embolisms caused by air bubbles are usually treated in a hyperbaric chamber. The air pressure inside the chamber is higher than the normal air pressure outside, which helps reduce the size of the air bubbles inside the body.","It isn't always possible to prevent embolisms, but there are things you can do to reduce your risk, including:
- eat a healthy diet - low in fat, high in fibre, including whole grains, fruit and vegetables
- limit the amount of salt in your diet to no more than 6g (1 teaspoon) a day
- lose weight if you're overweight or obese
- stop smoking, if you smoke
- exercise for a minimum of 150 minutes a week",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/embolism#toc-0
