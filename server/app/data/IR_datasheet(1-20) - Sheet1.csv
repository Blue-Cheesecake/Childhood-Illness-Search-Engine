Asthma,"Asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness. It is caused by inflammation of the small tubes, which carry air in and out of the lungs. Asthma can develop at any age, including in young children and older people.","The symptoms of asthma can range from mild to severe. Most people will only experience occasional symptoms, although a few people will have problems most of the time.

The main symptoms of asthma are:
- wheezing (a whistling sound when you breathe)
- shortness of breath
- a tight chest - which may feel like a band is tightening around it 
- coughing

These symptoms are often worse at night and early in the morning, particularly if the condition is not well controlled. They may also develop or become worse in response to a certain trigger, such as exercise or exposure to an allergen.

You should speak to your GP if you think you or your child may have asthma.

You should also talk to your doctor or asthma nurse if you have been diagnosed with asthma and you are finding it difficult to control your symptoms.

#Asthma attacks
When asthma symptoms get significantly worse, it is known as an asthma attack or acute asthma exacerbation.

Asthma attacks often develop slowly, sometimes taking a couple of days or more to become serious, although some people with asthma are prone to sudden, unexpected severe attacks. It is important to recognise attacks early and take appropriate action.

During an asthma attack, the symptoms described above may get worse. If you're already on treatment, your inhaler medication may not work as well as it normally does, or you may need to use your inhaler more often to relieve your symptoms.

If you think you or your child are having an asthma attack, don't ignore it. Use your asthma action plan if you have one.

Contact your GP or asthma clinic as soon as possible, if:
- you or your child does not have an action plan
- following the steps in your action plan does not lead to an improvement in the control of your or your child’s symptoms","If you have asthma you should be able to lead a full and unrestricted life. With the right treatment you can control your asthma and keep your symptoms at bay.

There are a variety of different treatments and medications for asthma, including inhaled medication and tablets.

Some of the medication used to treat asthma, called relievers, work to relieve your symptoms when they happen, while others, called preventers, help to control your symptoms and stop them happening.

It is important to take your medication as prescribed.","It's not clear exactly what causes asthma. Although the cause of asthma is unknown, a number of things that can increase your chances of developing the condition have been identified. These include:

- a family history of asthma or other related allergic conditions (known as atopic conditions) such as eczema, food allergy) or hay fever
- having another atopic condition
- having bronchiolitis (a common childhood lung infection) as a child
- childhood exposure to tobacco smoke, particularly if your mother also smoked during pregnancy 
- being born prematurely, especially if you needed a ventilator to support your breathing after birth
- having a low birth weight as a result of restricted growth within the womb

Some people may be at an increased risk of developing asthma by repeatedly breathing in certain substances, such as those related to their work. Many chemicals and types of dust can cause asthma symptoms.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/asthma
Bronchiolitis,"Bronchiolitis is a common viral lower respiratory tract infection that affects babies and young children under two years old. Most cases of bronchiolitis aren't serious, but sometimes a more serious infection such as pneumonia may be present. See section on ‘when to seek medical help’.","Most cases are mild and clear up without the need for treatment within two to three weeks. However, some children have severe symptoms and need hospital treatment.

The early symptoms of bronchiolitis are similar to those of a common cold, such as a runny nose and cough.

Further symptoms then usually develop over the next few days, including:
- a temperature (fever) (although may not be present and is rarely over 39°C)
- a dry and persistent cough
- difficulty feeding
- rapid or noisy breathing (wheezing)","There's no medication to kill the virus that causes bronchiolitis. The infection usually clears up within two weeks without the need for treatment. Most children can be cared for at home in the same way that you'd treat a cold.

Make sure your child gets enough fluid to avoid dehydration. You can give infants paracetamol or ibuprofen to bring down their temperature if the fever is upsetting them. 

Always check the instructions on the bottle or packet carefully, and never exceed the recommended dose. Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16.

About 2-3 per cent of babies who develop bronchiolitis during the first year of life will need to be admitted to hospital because they develop more serious symptoms, such as difficulty breathing. This is more common in premature babies (born before week 37 of pregnancy) and those born with a heart or lung condition.","It's difficult to prevent bronchiolitis. However, there are steps you can take to reduce your child's risk of catching it and help prevent the virus spreading. You should:
- wash your hands and your child's hands often
- wash or wipe toys and surfaces regularly
- keep infected children at home until their symptoms have improved
- keep newborn babies away from people with colds or flu
- prevent your child being exposed to tobacco smoke

Some children who are at high risk of developing severe bronchiolitis may require treatment to prevent the infection, or to limit the severity of the infection.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/bronchiolitis
Chickenpox,Chickenpox is a mild and common childhood illness that most children catch at some point. Chickenpox is caused by a virus. It's spread quickly and easily from someone who is infected.,"The most commonly recognised chickenpox symptom is a spotty, blistering red rash that can cover the entire body.

#Chickenpox spots 
Chickenpox spots normally appear in clusters 
The spots normally appear in clusters and tend to be:
- behind the ears
- on the face
- over the scalp
- on the chest and belly
- on the arms and legs

However, the spots can be anywhere on the body including:
- inside the ears and mouth 
- on the palms of the hands
- soles of the feet
- inside the nappy area

Although the rash starts as small, itchy red spots, these develop a blister on top and become intensely itchy after about 12-14 hours.

After a day or two, the fluid in the blisters gets cloudy and they begin to dry out and crust over. After one to two weeks, the crusting skin will fall off naturally.

#Feeling unwell 
However, even before the rash appears, you or your child may have some mild flu-like symptoms, including:
- feeling sick
- a high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or over
- aching, painful muscles
- headache
- generally feeling unwell
- loss of appetite

These flu-like symptoms, especially the fever, tend to be more common and worse in adults than in children.

#Unusual symptoms 
Most healthy children (and adults) recover from chickenpox with no lasting ill-effects simply by resting, just as with a cold or the flu.

However, some children and adults are unlucky and have a more severe bout.

Contact your GP straight away if you or your child develop any abnormal symptoms, such as:

- the skin surrounding the blisters becoming red and painful
- pain in the chest or difficulty breathing
- signs of dehydration, such as fewer wet nappies, drowsiness and cold hands and feet

In cases such as this, prescription medicine or hospital treatment may be needed.","Chickenpox can usually be treated at home.

You or your child will probably feel pretty miserable and uncomfortable, but treatment can help relieve the symptoms.

The following can help:
- use paracetamol to relieve fever and discomfort - don't use anti-inflammatory painkillers, such as ibuprofen, as they can sometimes make people with chickenpox very ill
- tap or pat the skin rather than scratching it - it's important to avoid scratching because this can lead to further problems
- drink plenty of fluids to stay hydrated

You can also buy calamine lotion, moisturising creams, cooling gels or an antihistamine medicine called chlorpheniramine to help reduce itching and soothe the skin.

Never give aspirin to a child under 16 as it can be dangerous for them.

Always read the packet or leaflet that comes with the medicine to check if it's suitable and how much to take. Speak to a pharmacist or your GP if you're unsure","Chickenpox is caused by the varicella-zoster virus. You catch it by coming into contact with someone who is infected.

The Public Health Agency recommends if your child has chickenpox you should inform their school or nursery and keep them at home while they are infectious. This is until the last blister has crusted over.

This usually takes five or six days after the rash begins.

If you have chickenpox, stay off work and at home until you're no longer infectious.

If either you or your child has chickenpox, it is also a good idea for you, or them, to avoid contact with:
- pregnant women
- newborn babies
- anyone who has a weak immune system, such as people who are having chemotherapy (a treatment for cancer) or taking steroid tablets

If someone in your household has chickenpox, you can help stop the virus spreading by wiping any objects or surfaces with a sterilising solution and making sure that any infected clothing or bedding is washed regularly.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/chickenpox
Common cold,"A cold is a mild viral infection of the nose, throat, sinuses and upper airways. It's a common infection and usually clears up on its own within a week or two. If you are fit and healthy, it’s unlikely to be serious. Painkillers can help reduce the symptoms of colds.","The symptoms of a cold usually develop within a day or two of becoming infected.

The main symptoms include:
- a sore throat
- a blocked or runny nose
- sneezing
- a cough
- a hoarse voice
- generally feeling unwell

Less common symptoms of a cold include:
- a fever (high temperature) - generally considered to be 38C (100.4F) or over (see fever in children)
- a headache
- earache - severe earache may be a sign of a middle ear infection
- muscle pain
- loss of taste and smell
- mild irritation of your eyes
- a feeling of pressure in your ears and face  

The symptoms are usually at their worst during the first two to three days, before they gradually start to improve. In adults and older children, they usually last about 7 to 10 days, but can last longer. A cough in particular can last for two or three weeks.

Colds tend to last longer in younger children who are under five, typically lasting around 10 to 14 days.

#Telling the difference between cold and flu
Cold and flu symptoms are similar but flu tends to be more severe.

Cold symptoms:
- appear gradually
- affects mainly your nose and throat
- makes you feel unwell, but you're OK to carry on as normal (for example, go to work)

Flu symptoms:
- appear quickly within a few hours
- affect more than just your nose and throat
- makes you feel exhausted and too unwell to carry on as normal","There's no cure for a cold, but you can look after yourself at home by:
- resting, drinking plenty of fluids and eating healthily(external link opens in a new window / tab)
- taking over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol(external link opens in a new window / tab) or ibuprofen(external link opens in a new window / tab), to reduce any - fever or discomfort
- using decongestant sprays or tablets to relieve a blocked nose
- trying remedies such as gargling salt water and sucking on menthol sweets

Many painkillers and decongestants are available from pharmacies without a prescription. They're generally safe for older children and adults to take.

However, they might not be suitable for babies, young children, pregnant women, people with certain underlying health conditions, and those taking certain other medications. Speak to a pharmacist if you're unsure.Help yourself feel better 

You can take some steps to reduce the effects of winter colds:

- keep warm by wearing layers of thin clothing
- take the recommended dosage of paracetamol or ibuprofen to ease aches and pains and keep your temperature down
- increase your fluid intake and reduce caffeinated drinks, such as tea, coffee and cola

There are different remedies available in pharmacies. You should follow a pharmacist’s advice if you are already taking painkillers or other medicines. Always check the instructions on the bottle or packet carefully, and never exceed the recommended dose. Never give aspirin to children under the age of 16.

","#Boost your immune system 
Your immune system helps you fight viruses.

To help your immune system:
- eat more fruit, vegetables and wholegrain foods 
- don't smoke or use recreational drugs as these stop your immune system from working properly
- exercise regularly

#Stop the spread of colds
Viruses cause colds and coughs. When you cough or sneeze you send tiny droplets of infected saliva into the air. This can pass viruses to other people.

To stop spreading germs:
- always carry tissues
- use a tissue to cover your nose and mouth every time you cough or sneeze
- use tissues once and throw them in a bin
- wash your hands regularly, and as soon as possible after sneezing or coughing",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/common-cold
Cough,Most coughs go away on their own within 3 weeks. There's usually no need to see a GP.,Cough,"#How you can treat a cough yourself
There are things you can do to help treat a cough. You should:
- rest
- drink plenty of fluids
- drink hot lemon with honey (not suitable for babies)

Hot lemon with honey has a similar effect as cough medicines.

#How to make hot lemon with honey at home
- squeeze half a lemon into a mug of boiled water
- add 1 to 2 teaspoons of honey
- drink while still warm (don't give hot drinks to small children)

#A pharmacist can help with a cough
Speak to your pharmacist if you have a cough. They can give you advice or suggest treatments to help you cough less, like cough syrups and lozenges. These won’t get rid of the cough.

Some cough medicines shouldn’t be given to children under 12.","#Cough for less than 3 weeks (acute cough) is most commonly caused by a viral infection of the upper airways, that causes a cold or flu

Other causes include:
- bronchitis - an infection of the main airways of the lungs (bronchi), causing them to become irritated and inflamed-  it bronchitis can be caused by either a virus or bacteria, although viral bronchitis is much more common
- pneumonia - a swelling (inflammation) of the tissue in one or both of your lungs - it's usually caused by an infection with a germ (bacterium or virus)
- asthma that is getting worse - asthma is a common long-term condition that can cause coughing, wheezing, chest tightness and breathlessness
- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease that is getting worse (COPD) - COPD is a lung condition that causes breathing problems

#Cough lasting 3-8 weeks (sub-acute cough) is often caused by the airways being left over sensitive following an infection, including:
- pneumonia and other chest infections
- cough following pertussis (whooping cough)  - a highly contagious bacterial chest infection-  it causes repeated coughing bouts and can make babies and young children in particular very ill

#Cough lasting more than 8 weeks (chronic cough) is commonly caused by exposure to cigarette smoke (either actively or passively).

Other causes include:
- hay fever -  a common allergic reaction to pollen -  it is a common cause of allergic irritation of the nose (allergic rhinitis)
- medication - angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors reduce blood pressure by relaxing your blood vessels (common examples are enalapril, lisinopril, perindopril and ramipril) - the most common side effect is a persistent dry cough
- upper airway cough syndrome (previously known as post-nasal drip syndrome) - apart from a chronic cough, there are abnormal sensations arising from the throat - for example, you may experience a sensation of something being stuck in the throat
- asthma that is not well controlled
- COPD that is not well controlled
- gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (GORD) - a common condition, where acid from the stomach leaks up into the oesophagus (gullet) - GORD causes symptoms such as heartburn and an unpleasant taste in the back of the mouth

#Less common causes of all types of cough include:
- achalasia - a rare disorder of the food pipe (oesophagus) - this can make it difficult to swallow food and drink
- lung cancer
inhaling food or other objects
- bronchiectasis - a long-term condition where the airways of the lungs become permanently abnormally widened, with thickened walls -  this leads to a build-up of excess mucus that can make the lungs more vulnerable to infection
- idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) - a condition in which the lungs become scarred and breathing becomes increasingly difficult
- pneumothorax - partial collapse of your lung caused by a small tear in the lung surface, which allows air to become trapped in the space around your lungs
pulmonary embolism - a blockage in the pulmonary artery - this is the blood vessel that carries blood from the heart to the lungs (this blockage, usually a blood clot, is potentially life-threatening)
- heart failure - where the heart is unable to pump blood around the body properly - this usually happens because the heart has become too weak or stiff (it can occur at any age, but is most common in older people)
- neuroendocrine tumour in the lung may cause a cough",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/cough
Croup,"Croup usually affects children between 6 months and 6 years of age, most often during their second year. It’s caused by a virus so antibiotics won’t help. Typically it causes a ‘seal-like’ barking cough. It's usually mild, but you should see your GP if your child appears unwell.","#Check if your child has croup
These are the symptoms of croup:
- a barking cough that sounds like a seal (you can hear examples online)
- a hoarse voice
- problems with breathing
- a rasping sound when breathing in

Your child will usually have cold-like symptoms to begin with, such as a temperature, runny nose and cough.

Croup symptoms usually come on after a few days and are often worse at night.

#If you’re not sure it’s croup
There are other conditions that have similar symptoms to croup, these include:
- runny nose, sneezing, cough and temperature: possible cause - cold
- cold-like symptoms, wheezing, rapid breathing, not feeding: possible cause - bronchiolitis
- cold-like symptoms with bouts of coughing - your child may whoop when breathing in: possible cause - whooping cough","#How to treat croup at home
Croup usually gets better on its own within 48 hours.

Until it does:

##Do
- stay calm
- sit your child upright
- comfort them if they're distressed (crying can make the symptoms worse)
- give them plenty of fluids

##Don't
- put your child in a steamy room or get them to inhale steam
- give them cough or cold medicines","#Croup is spread in a similar way to the common cold, so it is difficult to prevent.

Good hygiene is the main defence against croup, such as regularly washing hands and cleaning surfaces.

A number of your child's routine vaccinations also protect against some of the infections that can cause croup. These include:
- MMR - protection from measles, mumps and rubella
- DTaP/IPV/Hib - protection from diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough, polio and Haemophilus influenzae type b",TRUE,"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/croup

Diarrhoea and vomiting,"Diarrhoea and vomiting are common in adults, children and babies. You can have them together or on their own. They're usually caused by a stomach bug and should pass in a few days. See ‘when to get medical help’ sections if are concerned about you or your child’s symptoms.","Diarrhoea is where you frequently pass watery or loose poo. Some people may also have other symptoms, depending on the cause.

Associated symptoms can include:
- stomach cramps
- nausea and vomiting
- headache
- loss of appetite

The excessive loss of water in your poo can also sometimes lead to dehydration, which can be serious if it's not recognised and treated quickly.","You can usually treat yourself or your child at home.

The most important thing is to have plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration.

#Do
- stay at home and get plenty of rest
- drink lots of fluids, such as water and squash - take small sips if you feel sick
- carry on giving breast or bottle feeds to your baby - if they're being sick, try giving small feeds more often than usual
- for babies on formula or solid foods, give small sips of water between feeds
- eat when you feel able to - you don't need to have or avoid any specific foods
- take paracetamol if you're in discomfort - check the leaflet before giving paracetamol to your child

#Don't
- have fruit juice or fizzy drinks - they can make diarrhoea worse
- make baby formula weaker - use it at its usual strength
- give young children medicine to stop diarrhoea
- give aspirin to children under 16","You probably won't know exactly what the cause is, but the main causes of diarrhoea and vomiting are treated in the same way.

They're usually due to:
- a stomach bug (gastroenteritis)
- norovirus - also called the vomiting bug
- food poisoning

Other causes of diarrhoea
- medicines - check the leaflet to see if diarrhoea is a side effect
- a food intolerance or food allergy
- irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)
- inflammatory bowel disease
- coeliac disease
- diverticular disease

Other causes of vomiting
- pregnancy
- migraine
- labyrinthitis
- medicines - check the leaflet to see if vomiting is a side effect

Fever in children,"A fever is a high temperature. Generally, in children fever is a temperature of 38°C (100.4F) or over. It can be worrying if your child has a high temperature. Fever is very common and often clears up without treatment.","It can be difficult to tell when a child is seriously ill, but the main thing is to trust your instincts.

It is unlikely there is any serious illness if your child is:
- a normal colour
- active
- breathing normally
- smiling and responsive

Below are warning signs that might be serious.

#Colour
If your child:
- appears pale, it can be a sign that the illness is becoming more serious, and you should seek advice
- is mottled, ashen, or blue; this requires urgent assessment and may be an emergency

#Activity
If your child:
- is not responding  normally, and needs much more encouragement than usual to respond, you should seek advice
- becomes unresponsive, appears unusually unable to stay awake, displays weak, high-pitched, or continuous crying; this requires urgent assessment and may be an emergency

#Breathing
If your child:
- appears to be breathing more rapidly (this depends on their age) then you should seek medical advice 
-- 6-12 months of age: more than 50 breaths per minute 
-- over 12 months of age: more than 40 breaths per minute
- is grunting or appears distressed breathing or is taking more than 60 breaths per minute; this requires urgent assessment and may be an emergency

#Dehydration
- if symptoms or signs of dehydration are present you should seek advice","If your child has a fever, it's important to keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of cool water to drink.

Babies should be given plenty of liquids, such as breast milk or formula. Even if your child isn't thirsty, try to get them to drink little and often to keep their fluid levels up.

Other things that can help keep your child comfortable include:

dressing your child in light clothing (appropriate for their surroundings)
putting your child in a room with a comfortable temperature
if they're warm, covering them with a lightweight sheet or opening a window
Sponging your child with cool water isn't recommended to reduce a fever.","A quick and easy way to find out whether your child has a fever is to take their temperature using a thermometer.

Most fevers are caused by infections or other illnesses. The high body temperature makes it more difficult for the bacteria and viruses that cause infections to survive.

Common conditions that can cause fevers include:
- upper respiratory tract infections (RTIs)
- flu
- ear infections
- roseola - a virus that causes a temperature and a rash 
- tonsillitis
- kidney or urinary tract infections (UTIs)
- common childhood illnesses, such as chickenpox and whooping cough

Your child's temperature can also be raised after vaccinations, or if they overheat because of too much bedding or clothing.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/fever-children
Earache,"Earache is a common problem, particularly in children. It can be worrying, but it's usually caused by a minor infection and will often get better in a few days without treatment. This page has information on common causes of earache.","Earache can be a sharp, dull or burning pain in the ear that comes and goes or is constant. You may get pain in just one or both ears.","To treat the pain, you can use painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen. These can be bought over the counter. Children under the age of 16 shouldn't take aspirin.

If the discomfort is mild, and in the outer ear, placing a warm flannel against the affected ear may also help relieve the pain. Care must be taken to make sure the flannel is not hot, to avoid scalding or burning of the skin.

Your pharmacist may be able to recommend over-the-counter eardrops for your earache. Tell them about your symptoms and ask for their advice first.

Eardrops or olive oil drops shouldn't be used if your eardrum has burst (a perforated eardrum), and if treating an ear infection.

It's important to avoid getting the affected ear wet if you have an ear infection.","#Ear infections 
If an ear infection is causing your earache, there may be a watery or pus-like fluid coming out of your ear.

Common causes of earache include:
- outer ear infections (infections of the tube connecting the outer ear and eardrum)
- middle ear infections (infections of the parts of the ear behind the eardrum) are very common causes of earache

Ear infections often clear up on their own without treatment after a few days or weeks.

Many infections in the middle ear are viral and would not improve with antibiotic treatment.

Many outer ear symptoms can be caused by non-infectious conditions such as dermatitis. In some cases, depending on the cause, your GP may prescribe eardrops or antibiotics.

#Glue ear 
Glue ear is also known as otitis media with effusion (OME). It is a build-up of fluid deep inside the ear. Glue ear commonly causes some temporary hearing loss. The condition tends to be painless. However, sometimes the pressure created by the fluid can cause earache.

Glue ear often clears up on its own. This can take a few months. If the problem is ongoing, a minor procedure to place small tubes called grommets in the ear may be recommended. This is to help drain the fluid.

#Ear damage 
Earache can sometimes be caused by an injury to the inside of the ear - for example, by:
- scraping earwax from the ear canal using a cotton bud
- poking a cotton bud too far into your ear, which can puncture the eardrum

The ear canal is very sensitive and can be easily damaged. The ear should heal on its own without treatment. It can take up to two months for a perforated eardrum to heal.

If you have a perforated eardrum, you shouldn't use eardrops.

#Earwax 
A build-up of earwax can sometimes cause earache.

If you have a build-up of earwax in your ear, your pharmacist will be able to recommend eardrops to soften it so it falls out naturally.

In some cases, your GP may need to remove the wax (once softened with eardrops) by flushing the ear with water. This is known as ear irrigation.

#An object in the ear 
If there's something in your or your child's ear that's causing pain, don't try to remove it yourself. This is because you may push it further inside which could damage the eardrum.

Contact your GP or GP out of hours service. Your GP may need to refer you or your child to a specialist to have it removed.

#Throat infections 
If you find it painful to swallow and you have a sore throat, your earache could be a symptom of a throat infection, such as:
- tonsillitis - inflammation of the tonsils that's usually caused by a viral infection
- quinsy - an abscess on one side of the back of your throat, which can sometimes make it very difficult to swallow even fluids

Most sore throats clear up after a few days without the need for antibiotics. 

If you have quinsy, you'll need to see your GP as soon as possible for treatment. You may have quinsy if you have a sore throat that gets worse very quickly.

#Jaw problem 
Earache can be caused by a problem with the joint of your jaw bone (where the jaw meets the skull).

This is known as temporomandibular joint pain and can occur as a result of problems such as arthritis or teeth grinding.

Jaw pain can often be relieved:
- with painkillers
- warm or cold compresses
- trying not to clench your jaw and grind your teeth

#Dental abscess 
A dental abscess is a collection of pus that can form in your teeth or gums as a result of a bacterial infection. The main symptom is pain in the affected tooth, which can be intense and throbbing. Sometimes, the pain can spread to your ear.

Make a dental appointment as soon as possible if you think you have a dental abscess. Your dentist will need to remove the source of the infection and drain the pus from the abscess.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/earache
Kawasaki disease,Kawasaki disease is a rare condition that mainly affects children under the age of five. It's also known as mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome. See your GP if your child is unwell and has the symptoms in the section below.,"The characteristic symptoms of Kawasaki disease are a high temperature that lasts for more than five days, with:
- a rash
- swollen glands in the neck
- dry, cracked lips
- changes in the hands and feet (redness and swelling at the start, peeling of skin in fingers and toes later)
- red eyes

After a few weeks the symptoms become less severe, but may last longer.
","Kawasaki disease is usually treated in hospital as it can sometimes lead to serious complications.

The health professional looking after your child’s care will discuss treatment options with you.

It's best if treatment begins as soon as possible, ideally within 10 days of the symptoms starting.

The sooner treatment starts, the quicker the recovery time and the less risk there is of complications developing.

Measles,"Measles is a highly infectious viral illness. It can be unpleasant and sometimes leads to serious complications. It's now uncommon because of the effectiveness of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination programme. Anyone can get measles if they haven't been vaccinated or they haven't had it before.","Measles begins with cold-like symptoms that develop about 10 days after becoming infected. This is followed a few days later by the measles rash.

For most people, the illness lasts around seven to 10 days in total.

#Initial symptoms 
The initial symptoms of measles can include:
- a runny or blocked nose
- sneezing
- watery eyes
- swollen eyelids
- sore, red eyes that may be sensitive to light
- a high temperature (fever), which may reach around 40C (104F)
- small greyish-white spots in the mouth (see below)
- aches and pains
- a cough
- loss of appetite
- tiredness, irritability and a general lack of energy

#Spots in the mouth 
A day or two before the rash appears, many people with measles develop small greyish-white spots in their mouth (Koplik spots).

Not everyone with measles has these spots, but if someone has them as well as the other symptoms listed above or a rash, it's highly likely they have the condition.","Measles can be unpleasant but it will usually pass in about seven to 10 days.

It is likely to cause unpleasant symptoms including rash, fever, malaise (feeling unwell), cough, and conjunctivitis (see symptoms section).

There are several things you can do to help relieve your symptoms and reduce the risk of spreading the infection. These include:
- taking paracetamol or ibuprofen to relieve fever, aches and pains - aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old
- drinking plenty of water to avoid dehydration
- closing the curtains to help reduce light sensitivity
- using damp cotton wool to clean the eyes
- staying off school or work for at least four days from when the rash first appears and avoid contact with susceptible people (that is, people who are not fully immunised through vaccination or natural exposure, infants, pregnant women, or immunosuppressed people)

In severe cases, especially if there are complications, you or your child may need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.","Measles can be prevented by having the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

The MMR vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule.  Adults and older children can be vaccinated at any age if they haven't been fully vaccinated before.  Ask your GP about having the vaccination.

If the MMR vaccine isn't suitable for you, a treatment called human normal immunoglobulin (HNIG) can be used if you're at immediate risk of catching measles.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/measles
Meningitis,Meningitis is an infection of the protective membranes (layers) that surround the brain and spinal cord. Meningitis can be serious if not treated quickly. Call 999 for an ambulance or go to your nearest emergency department if you think you or your child might be seriously ill.,"Meningitis can affect anyone, but is common in babies, young children, teenagers and young adults. Symptoms of meningitis develop suddenly and can include: 
- a high temperature (fever) over 37.5C (99.5F)
- being sick
- a headache
- a blotchy rash that doesn't fade when a glass is rolled over it (this won't always develop)  
- a stiff neck
- a dislike of bright lights
- drowsiness or unresponsiveness
- seizures (fits)

Babies may also:
- refuse feeds
- be agitated and not want to be picked up
- have a bulging soft spot on their head (fontanelle)
- be floppy or unresponsive
- have an unusual high-pitched cry
- have a stiff body

These symptoms can appear in any order and some may not appear.","People with suspected meningitis will usually have tests in hospital to confirm the diagnosis and check whether the condition is the result of a viral or bacterial infection.

Bacterial meningitis usually needs to be treated in hospital for at least a week.

Viral meningitis tends to get better on its own within 7 to 10 days. It can often be treated at home. Getting plenty of rest and taking painkillers and anti-sickness medication can help relieve the symptoms in the meantime.","Meningitis can be caused by a number of different infections, so several vaccinations offer some protection against it.

Children should receive most of these as part of the vaccination schedule. Speak to your GP if you're not sure whether you or your child's vaccinations are up-to-date.

You can read more about vaccinations against meningitis in ‘more useful links’ section below.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/meningitis
Mumps,"Mumps is a contagious infection caused by the mumps virus. It used to be common in children before the introduction of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine. It's important to contact your GP if you think you or your child has mumps so a diagnosis can be made.","The symptoms of mumps usually develop 14 to 25 days after becoming infected with the mumps virus. This delay is known as the incubation period.

Painful swellings at the side of the face under the ears (the parotid glands) are the most common symptom of mumps.

The parotid glands are a pair of glands that produce saliva. Both glands are usually affected by the swelling (‘parotitis’), although only one gland can be affected.

The swelling can cause pain, tenderness and difficulty with swallowing.

More general symptoms often develop a few days before the parotid glands swell. These can include:
- non-specific symptoms, such as a temperature 38C (100.4F), or above, headache, earache, feeling of being unwell, muscle ache, and loss of appetite
- epididymo-orchitis (inflammation/swelling of the testicles) -  in adult men, it is usually in one testicle and in some men, both testicles will be affected (this can sometimes cause reduced fertility)
- oophoritis (inflammation of the ovaries) - affects a small amount of women and causes nausea, vomiting, and lower abdominal pain - it rarely causes complications
- viral meningitis - affects up to 10 per cent of people who contract mumps
- deafness - affects a small amount of people, but is rarely permanent
- pancreatitis (causes upper abdominal (stomach) discomfort) - affects about four per cent of people, but is nearly always mild and lasts a short time

In about one in three cases, mumps doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms.","There's currently no cure for mumps. The infection should pass within one or two weeks.

Treatment is used to relieve symptoms and includes:
- getting plenty of bed rest and fluids
- using painkillers, such as ibuprofen and paracetamol - aspirin shouldn't be given to children under 16
- applying a warm or cool compress to the swollen glands to help relieve pain","#Cause of mumps
Mumps is caused by the mumps virus, which belongs to a family of viruses known as paramyxoviruses.

These viruses are a common source of infection, particularly in children.

#Preventing mumps 
You can protect your child against mumps by making sure they're given the combined MMR vaccine (for mumps, measles and rubella).

The MMR vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation schedule.

Roseola,Roseola is a common viral infection that usually affects babies and toddlers. It typically causes a fever and a spotty rash for a few days. Roseola tends to be mild and you can normally look after your child at home. They'll usually recover within a week.,"Roseola can also affect older children and adults. This is uncommon because most children will have been infected by the time they start nursery and it's rare to get it more than once.

Roseola doesn't always cause noticeable symptoms. If they do develop, they'll usually start a week or two after becoming infected.

#Fever
At first, your child may have:
- a sudden high temperature (fever) of 38C (100.4F) or above - find out how to take your child's temperature
- a sore throat 
- a runny nose
- a cough
- mild diarrhoea
- loss of appetite
- swollen eyelids and swollen glands in their neck

These symptoms typically last three to five days, at which point a rash often appears.

Some children also have fits (seizures) known as febrile seizures. These can be frightening, but are usually harmless.

#Rash
The roseola rash usually appears once the fever has gone down.

The rash:
- is made up of pinkish-red spots, patches or bumps - these should fade if you roll a glass over them
- tends to start on the chest, tummy and back, before spreading to the face, neck and arms
- isn't usually itchy or uncomfortable
- normally fades and disappears within two days

It can be difficult to tell the rash apart from similar childhood infections, such as measles, rubella or scarlet fever.","You can usually look after your child at home until they're feeling better. There’s no specific treatment, but the following can help:
- let your child rest if they feel unwell - they may be more comfortable if they stay in bed until they're better, but there's no need to force them to rest if they seem well enough
- keep them hydrated by giving them plenty of water or squash to drink - if you're breastfeeding or bottle feeding your baby, keep feeding them regularly
- keep them cool if their room is warm - for example, use a lightweight sheet on their bed rather than a heavy duvet
- give them children's paracetamol or ibuprofen if their fever is making them uncomfortable - always read the leaflet that comes with the medication to find the right dose

Don't give your child paracetamol and ibuprofen at the same time. If one doesn't work, you may want to try the other one later.

Never give aspirin to children under 16 unless advised to by a doctor.","Roseola is spread in a similar way to the common cold - through coughs and sneezes, and contaminated objects or surfaces.

It doesn't spread very easily. You don't need to keep your child away from nursery or school if they're feeling well enough to go.

If they're unwell, keep them at home until they feel better. Although there's no need to wait until the last spot disappears.

The following may help stop the infection spreading to others:
- make sure you and your child wash your hands often
- make sure your child sneezes and coughs into tissues - throw away used tissues immediately and wash your hands
- clean surfaces regularly
- don't share cups, plates, cutlery and kitchen utensils

It's unclear exactly how long a child with roseola is contagious. They may be able to pass on the infection the whole time they're ill, including before the rash develops.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/roseola
Rubella,"Rubella (German measles) is a viral infection. It's now uncommon in Northern Ireland because of the effectiveness of the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccination programme, with high levels of vaccination. You should always contact your GP if you think you or your child has rubella.","Rubella is usually a mild condition that gets better without treatment in seven to 10 days.

Symptoms of rubella include:
- a red-pink skin rash made up of small spots
‘- swollen glands’ (lymph nodes) around the head and neck (these feel like firm pea-like swellings below the skin)
- a high temperature (fever)
- cold-like symptoms such as a cough and runny nose
- aching and painful joints - more common in adults

The rubella rash:
- is typically a red-pink colour
- consists of a number of small spots, which may be slightly itchy
- usually starts behind the ears before spreading around the head and neck
- may then spread to the chest and tummy (the trunk), and legs and arms

In most cases the rash disappears by itself within three to five days.

The symptoms of rubella usually only last a few days. Your ‘glands’ may be swollen for several weeks.","There's no specific treatment for rubella. Symptoms normally pass within seven to 10 days. If you or your child are finding the symptoms uncomfortable, you can treat some of these at home.

For example, paracetamol or ibuprofen can be used to reduce the fever and treat any aches or pains. Liquid infant paracetamol can be used for young children.

Aspirin shouldn't be given to children under the age of 16 years.","The best way to avoid catching rubella is to be immunised with the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccine.

The MMR vaccine is part of the routine childhood immunisation programme.  Contact your GP if you're uncertain whether your child's vaccinations are up-to-date. It's possible to have the MMR vaccination at any age.

If you suspect your immunisation isn't up-to-date and you're at risk of catching mumps, measles or rubella, your GP may recommend the MMR vaccine.

For example, this may be necessary if there's an outbreak of measles or you're a woman planning to get pregnant.

You can get your GP practice to check your vaccination history.

Eczema (atopic),"Atopic (allergy related) eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is the most common form of eczema. It mainly affects children, but can also affect adults.
","Eczema is a condition that causes the skin to become itchy, red, dry and cracked. It is a long-term (chronic) condition in most people. However it can improve over time, especially in children. 

Atopic eczema can affect any part of the body. The most common areas affected are:  
- backs or fronts of the knees (usually at the front in babies)
- back or front of the skin crease at the bend of the elbows (usually at the back in babies)
- around the neck
- hands
- cheeks
- scalp (usually in babies) 

#Signs of an infection 
Occasionally, areas of skin affected by atopic eczema can become infected. Signs of an infection can include:
- your eczema getting a lot worse
- fluid oozing from the skin
- a yellow crust on the skin surface or small yellowish-white spots appearing in the eczema
- the skin becoming swollen and sore
- a high temperature (fever) and generally feeling unwell

See your doctor as soon as possible if you think your or your child's skin may have become infected.

People with atopic eczema usually have periods when symptoms are less noticeable. There can also be times when symptoms become more severe (flare-ups).","There is currently no cure for atopic eczema. Treatment can help relieve the symptoms of atopic eczema. Many cases improve over time.

However, severe eczema often has a significant impact on daily life (see link below for more information). There is also an increased risk of skin infections. 

Many different treatments can be used to control symptoms and manage eczema, including:
- self care techniques, such as reducing scratching and avoiding triggers
- emollients (moisturising treatments) - used on a daily basis for dry skin 
- topical corticosteroids - used to reduce swelling, redness and itching during flare-ups","The exact cause of atopic eczema is unknown. However, it is thought that it's not down to one single thing. It often occurs in people who get allergies. The word atopic means sensitivity to allergens.

It is a combination of having an inherited tendency to it, and exposure to triggers in the environment that cause it to develop.

It can run in families. It can often develop alongside other conditions, such as asthma and hay fever.

The symptoms of atopic eczema often have certain triggers, such as soaps, detergents, stress and the weather. Sometimes food allergies can play a part, especially in young children with severe eczema.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/eczema-atopic
