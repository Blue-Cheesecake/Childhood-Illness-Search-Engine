Acute cholecystitis,"Acute cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder. It usually, but not always, occurs when a gallstone blocks the cystic duct. Acute cholecystitis is potentially serious. It usually needs to be treated in hospital.","Gallstones are small stones that form in the gallbladder. They are formed from bile. This is a substance stored in the gallbladder and released into the gut. It helps to digest the fats we eat in food.

Bile contains a mixture of salts, cholesterol and bilirubin. Bilirubin is formed by the breakdown of red blood cells in the body.

Gallstones usually (but not always) develop when cholesterol levels in the bile are too high, and excess cholesterol turns into stones.

Gallstones are very common. They don't usually cause symptoms, but they can occasionally cause episodes of pain (biliary colic) or acute cholecystitis.

The main symptom of acute cholecystitis is a sudden sharp pain in the upper right-hand side of your tummy (abdomen). This pain spreads towards your right shoulder.

Unlike other types of abdominal pain, the pain of acute cholecystitis is usually persistent. The pain doesn't usually go away within a few hours.

Some people may have other symptoms, such as:
- a high temperature (fever)
- nausea and vomiting
- sweating
- loss of appetite
- yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes (jaundice)
- a bulge in the abdomen","If you're diagnosed with acute cholecystitis, you'll probably need to be admitted to hospital for treatment.

After initial treatment, any gallstones that may have caused acute cholecystitis usually fall back into the gallbladder. The inflammation will often calm down.

#Surgery
Removing your gallbladder may be recommended at some point after initial treatment. This is to prevent acute cholecystitis recurring. This is also to reduce your risk of developing potentially serious complications. 

The consultant surgeon at the hospital will discuss with you whether surgery is the best option.

Although some people who've had their gallbladder removed have reported symptoms of bloating and diarrhoea after eating certain foods, it's possible to lead a perfectly normal life without a gallbladder.

The organ is useful, but it's not essential.","It isn't always possible to prevent acute cholecystitis. You can lower your risk of developing it by reducing your risk of getting gallstones.

One of the main things you can do to lower your chances of getting gallstones is to adopt a healthy, balanced diet.  Also reducing the number of high-cholesterol foods you eat, as cholesterol is thought to contribute to the formation of gallstones.

Being overweight, particularly being obese, also increases your risk of developing gallstones. Having a healthy diet and exercise regularly is important to help maintain good health.

Low-calorie rapid weight loss diets should be avoided. A more gradual weight loss plan is best. ",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/acute-cholecystitis
Allergic rhinitis,"Allergic rhinitis is inflammation of the inside of the nose. It’s caused by an allergic reaction to an allergen, such as pollen, dust and the hair of certain animals. It’s a common condition. See your GP if your symptoms, see below, are stopping you from doing everyday activities.","Allergic rhinitis typically causes cold-like symptoms, such as:
- sneezing
- itchiness
- a blocked or runny nose

These symptoms usually start soon after being exposed to an allergen.

Some people only get allergic rhinitis for a few months at a time because they're sensitive to seasonal allergens, such as tree or grass pollen (hay fever). Other people get allergic rhinitis all year round.

Most people with allergic rhinitis have mild symptoms that can be easily treated. For some symptoms can be severe and persistent. They can cause sleep problems and interfere with everyday life.

The symptoms of allergic rhinitis occasionally improve with time. This can take many years and it's unlikely that the condition will disappear completely.

#Non-allergic rhinitis
Not all cases of rhinitis are caused by an allergic reaction. Some cases are the result of:
- an infection, such as the common cold
- oversensitive blood vessels in the nose
- overuse of nasal decongestants

This type of rhinitis is known as non-allergic rhinitis.","It's difficult to completely avoid potential allergens. You can take steps to reduce exposure to a particular allergen you know or suspect is triggering your allergic rhinitis.

You can also help reduce the symptoms by taking over-the-counter medications. Your pharmacist can advise you. Regularly rinsing your nasal passages with a salt water to keep it free of irritants can also help.","Allergic rhinitis is caused by the immune system reacting to an allergen as if it were harmful.

This results in cells releasing a number of chemicals that cause the inside layer of your nose (the mucous membrane) to become swollen and excessive levels of mucus to be produced.

Common allergens that cause allergic rhinitis include:
- pollen - this type of allergic rhinitis is known as hay fever
- mould spores
- house dust mites
- flakes of skin or droplets of urine or saliva from certain animals",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/allergic-rhinitis
Balanitis,"Balanitis is a skin irritation on the head of the penis that can affect men and boys. It's not usually serious, but you should see your GP if you think you or your son has balanitis.","Balanitis affects the head of the penis and the foreskin. 

It occurs far more often in men and boys who haven't been circumcised.

Symptoms include:
- a sore, itchy and smelly penis
- redness and swelling
- pus
- small, eroded, itchy spots/plaques may be present with a white cheese-like matter, which can be rubbed off easily
- pain when peeing

Some adults may also have a tight foreskin that won't pull back. This is a condition called phimosis.","Most cases of balanitis are easily treated with good hygiene and, if necessary, medication recommended by your GP.

See your GP if the treatment doesn't start to work within seven days. You may need another treatment or be advised to see a specialist.

Circumcision may be advised in rare cases where a child keeps getting balanitis.

#Hygiene
If you have balanitis, you should clean your penis daily with lukewarm water and gently dry it.
- don't use soap, bubble bath, shampoo or any other potential irritant
- dry gently under the foreskin after peeing
- try a soap substitute like an emollient, available from a pharmacy 

#Cleaning a child's penis
- don't pull back their foreskin to clean under it if it's still fixed
- if the child is still in nappies, change them often
- don't use baby wipes to clean their penis

#Sex and balanitis
You can have sex during treatment if your balanitis is not caused by infection.

If it's caused by an infection, like an STI or thrush, there's a risk of passing this on.","You can reduce your chances of getting balanitis by:
- keeping your penis clean
- avoiding harsh soaps and other skin irritants
- using soap substitutes, such as an emollient
- practising safe sex to avoid an STI
- using latex-free condoms if you have a latex allergy

Young boys may not yet be able to clean under their foreskin because it may not fully pull back yet. 

Don't try to pull back a child's foreskin to clean under it if it's still fixed, as this can cause damage.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/balanitis
Boils and carbuncles,"Boils and carbuncles are red, painful lumps that form just under the surface of the skin. They are usually caused by a bacterial infection.","#Boils 

Boils can develop anywhere on your skin. But you're most likely to get a boil in an area where there's a combination of hair, sweat and friction, such as the face, neck, armpits or thighs.

Over time, pus forms inside the boil, making it bigger and more painful. Most boils eventually burst. The pus then drains away without leaving a scar. This can take from two days to three weeks to happen.

It can sometimes be difficult to tell the difference between a boil and a spot. But boils tend to grow bigger and become more painful. Your GP should be able to diagnose a boil from its appearance.

#Carbuncles
A carbuncle is a dome-shaped cluster of boils. It usually develops over a few days. The areas most commonly affected are the back, thighs, or back of the neck. 

A carbuncle can grow to a size of 3-10cm and will leak pus from a number of points.

You may also:
- have a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above
- feel generally unwell
- feel weak and exhausted

Carbuncles are less common than boils. They tend to mostly affect middle-aged or older men in poor health or with a weakened immune system. Boils are common in adolescents and young adults.","You're likely to need further treatment if you keep getting boils or carbuncles.

Most people who keep getting boils are carriers of Staphylococcus aureus (staph bacteria). This means they have staph bacteria living on their skin or inside their nose.

Treatment will depend on where the bacteria are found on your body. Your GP will advise you about treatment.

#Self care 
Most boils get better without the need for medical treatment.

One of the best ways to speed up healing is to apply a warm, moist face cloth to the boil for 10-20 minutes, three or four times a day.

Be careful not to use water that's too hot. Make sure the face cloth is not too warm to avoid a scald or burn. Test how warm it is using the skin on the back of your hand.

The heat increases the amount of blood circulating around the boil. This sends more infection-fighting white blood cells to the area.

When the boil bursts, cover it with sterile gauze or a dressing. This is to prevent the spread of infection.

Afterwards, wash your hands thoroughly using hot water and soap.

Never squeeze or pierce a boil because it could spread the infection.

You can use over-the-counter painkillers, such as paracetamol or ibuprofen, to help relieve any pain caused by the boil.","You can't always avoid getting a boil or carbuncle, but these simple steps can reduce your risk:
- wash your skin regularly using a mild antibacterial soap
- carefully clean any cuts, wounds or grazes (even small ones) 
- cover cuts, wounds and grazes with a sterile bandage until they heal
- eat healthily and exercise regularly to boost your immune system",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/boils-and-carbuncles
Botulism,"Botulism is a rare, life-threatening condition, with toxins that attack the nervous system. Most people make a full recovery with treatment. If not treated quickly paralysis can spread to the muscles controlling breathing. It can be fatal. Go to the nearest emergency department if you get any symptoms of paralysis.","The time it takes to develop symptoms can vary from a few hours to several days after exposure to the Clostridium botulinum bacteria or their toxins.

Depending on the exact type of the condition, some people have general symptoms to begin with, such as:
- feeling sick and vomiting
- stomach cramps
- diarrhoea or constipation

Without treatment, botulism eventually causes paralysis that spreads down the body from the head to the legs. Symptoms can include:
- drooping eyelids
- blurred or double vision
- facial muscle weakness
- difficulty swallowing
- slurred speech
- difficulty breathing

Affected babies may also have a weak cry, find it difficult to feed and have a floppy head, neck and limbs.","Botulism needs to be treated in hospital.

The way it's treated depends on which type of botulism you have, but treatment will usually involve:
- neutralising the toxins with injections of special antitoxins or antibodies
- supporting the functions of the body, such as breathing, until you recover

Treatment won't reverse any paralysis that's already been caused by the toxin, but it will stop it getting any worse.

In most people, paralysis that occurred before treatment will gradually improve over the following weeks or months.","As a result of high standards of food hygiene in Northern Ireland, the chances of getting food-borne botulism from food bought in this country is low.

There's a slightly higher risk if you produce your own food, particularly if this involves canning. Following food hygiene procedures and canning recommendations will reduce any risk.

You should also avoid eating food from visibly bulging or damaged cans, foul-smelling preserved foods, foods stored at the incorrect temperature and out of date foods.

Heroin users should avoid injecting heroin into their muscles. Injecting heroin into a vein or smoking it can reduce the risk of botulism, although not using heroin at all is by far the best course of action.

The specific cause is not identified in many cases of infant botulism, so it may not always be possible to prevent it. You should avoid giving honey to babies less than 12 months old because it has been known to contain Clostridium botulinum spores.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/botulism
Cardiomyopathy,"Cardiomyopathy is a general term for diseases of the heart muscle, where the walls of the heart chambers have become stretched, thickened or stiff. This affects the heart's ability to pump blood around the body.","There may be no symptoms in the early stages of cardiomyopathy. As it gets worse symptoms can include:
- breathlessness - this may occur after activity or at rest; it may be worse when you're lying down, and you may wake up at night needing to catch your breath
- fatigue - you may feel tired most of the time and find exercise exhausting
- swollen ankles and legs - this is caused by a build-up of fluid (oedema); it may be better in the morning and get worse later in the day
- a bloated tummy
- a persistent cough, which may be worse at night
- a pounding, fluttering or irregular heartbeat (palpitations)
- dizziness and fainting","There's no cure for cardiomyopathy. But the treatments described below are usually effective at controlling symptoms and preventing complications.

Not everyone with cardiomyopathy will need treatment. Some people only have a mild form of the disease that they can control after making a few lifestyle changes.

#Lifestyle changes
If the cause of your cardiomyopathy isn't genetic, it should generally help to:
- follow a healthy diet and take gentle exercise
- quit smoking (if you smoke)
- lose weight (if you're overweight)
- avoid or reduce your intake of alcohol 
- get plenty of sleep
- manage stress
- make sure any underlying condition, such as diabetes, is well controlled ","Medication may be needed to control blood pressure, correct an abnormal heart rhythm, remove excess fluid or prevent blood clots. ",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/cardiomyopathy
Cerebral palsy,"Cerebral palsy is the name for a group of lifelong conditions that affect movement and co-ordination, caused by a problem with the brain that occurs before, during or soon after birth. Speak to your health visitor or GP if you have any concerns about your child's health or development.","The symptoms of cerebral palsy aren't usually obvious just after a baby is born. They normally become noticeable during the first two or three years of a child's life.

Symptoms can include:
- delays in reaching development milestones - for example, not sitting by eight months or not walking by 18 months
- seeming too stiff or too floppy
- weak arms or legs
- fidgety, jerky or clumsy movements
- random, uncontrolled movements
- walking on tip-toes
- a range of other problems - such as difficulty swallowing, speaking problems, vision problems and learning disabilities

The severity of symptoms can vary significantly. Some people only have minor problems, while others may be severely disabled.
","There's currently no cure for cerebral palsy, but treatments are available to help people with the condition have a normal and independent a life as possible.

Treatments include:
- physiotherapy - techniques such as exercise and stretching to help maintain physical ability and hopefully improve movement problems
- speech therapy to help with speech and communication problems, and difficulty swallowing
- occupational therapy - where a therapist identifies problems that you or your child have carrying out everyday tasks and suggests ways to make these easier
- medication for muscle stiffness and other problems
- in some cases, surgery to treat movement or growth problems

A team of healthcare professionals will work with you to come up with a treatment plan that meets your or your child's needs.","Cerebral palsy can occur if a baby's brain doesn't develop normally while in the womb, or is damaged during or soon after birth.

Causes of cerebral palsy include:
- bleeding in the baby's brain or reduced blood and oxygen supply to their brain
- an infection caught by the mother during pregnancy
- the brain temporarily not getting enough oxygen (asphyxiation) during a difficult birth
- meningitis
- a serious head injury

But in many cases, the exact cause isn't clear. ",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/cerebral-palsy
Dehydration,"Dehydration occurs when your body loses more fluid than you take into your body.
","Water makes up over two-thirds of the healthy human body. It lubricates the joints and eyes, helps digestion, flushes out waste and toxins, and keeps the skin healthy.

When the normal water content of your body is reduced, it upsets the balance of minerals (salts and sugar) in your body. This affects the way your body functions.

Signs of dehydration can vary depending on how much of your body weight is lost through fluids.

Early warning signs of dehydration include:
- thirst
- dark-coloured urine

This is the body's way of trying to increase water intake and decrease water loss.

You should be able to reverse dehydration at this stage by drinking more fluids.

Dehydration can lead to a loss of strength and stamina. It's a main cause of heat exhaustion.

#Dehydration in children 
Signs of moderate dehydration in a child include:
- appears to be unwell or deteriorating
- altered responsiveness (for example irritable, lethargic)
- skin colour unchanged
- decreased urine output
- rapid breathing 
-- in a child of 6-12 months of age, of more than 50 breaths per minute
-- over 12 months of age, of more than 40 breaths per minute 
- a faster heart rate than usual
-- over 160 beats per minute  is a fast heart rate in a child under 1 year of age
-- over 150 beats/minute in a child 1-2 years of age 
-- over 140 beats per minute in a child 2-5 years of age

Signs of severe dehydration in a child include:
- decreased level of consciousness
- pale or mottled skin
- cold extremities, (that is, hands and feet)
- more rapid breathing
- an even faster heart rate

#Dehydration in babies 
A baby may be dehydrated if they have:
- a sunken soft spot (fontanelle) on their head
- few or no tears when they cry
- a dry mouth
- fewer wet nappies
- dark yellow urine
- drowsiness
- fast breathing
- cold and blotchy-looking hands and feet","#Babies 
- if you think your baby is dehydrated, take them to see your GP as soon as possible -they'll be able to recommend appropriate treatments
- give your baby plenty of liquids, such as breastmilk or formula -  it can often be better to give them smaller amounts of fluid more often
- don't dilute your baby's formula (if you use it) -  babies who are formula-fed and those on solids can be given extra water
- avoid giving your baby fruit juice, particularly if they have diarrhoea and vomiting, because it can make it worse
- giving your baby regular sips (a few times an hour) of oral rehydration solution in addition to their usual feed (breastmilk, formula milk and water) will help to replace lost fluids, salts and sugars

#Infants and children 
- infants and children who are dehydrated shouldn't be given solely water, because it can dilute the already low level of minerals in their body and make the problem worse
- instead, they should have diluted squash or a special oral rehydration solution  (see below)
- if you or your child is finding it difficult to hold down fluids because of vomiting, take smaller amounts more often. You may find it easier to use a spoon or a syringe to give your child small amounts of fluid","You should drink plenty of fluids to avoid becoming dehydrated.

Most of the time, you can prevent dehydration by drinking water regularly throughout the day. Be guided by your thirst. However in hot weather, when exercising and during illness, you should drink more.

As a guide, passing pale or clear-coloured urine (pee) is a good sign that you're well hydrated.

It is important for children to replace lost fluid, to prevent dehydration. Like adults, children lose more water when they are in hotter climates and when they are physically active.

You should give your child healthy drinks as part of an overall healthy, balanced diet.

Dengue,Dengue is a viral infection spread by mosquitoes. It's widespread in many parts of the world. There's no specific treatment or widely available vaccine for dengue. So it's important to try to avoid being bitten by mosquitoes when visiting an area where the infection is found.,"Symptoms of dengue usually develop suddenly 4 to 10 days after becoming infected.

Symptoms can include:
- a high temperature (fever), which can reach 40C (104F) or higher
- a severe headache
- pain behind the eyes
- muscle and joint pain
- feeling or being sick
- a widespread red rash
- loss of appetite

The symptoms normally pass in about a week, although you may feel tired and slightly unwell for several weeks afterwards.

In about 5 cases of infection in every 100, severe dengue can develop after the first symptoms. In a small number of cases, a person with severe dengue may die.
","There's no cure or specific treatment for dengue. Treatment involves relieving your symptoms while the infection runs its course.

You can usually look after yourself at home.

The following can help:
- take paracetamol to relieve pain and fever - avoid aspirin or ibuprofen, as these can cause bleeding problems in people with dengue
- drink plenty of fluids to prevent dehydration - if you're currently abroad, only drink bottled water from properly sealed bottles
- get plenty of rest

You should start to feel better in around a week. Although it may be a few weeks before you feel your normal self again. Get medical advice if your symptoms don't improve.","There's currently no widely available vaccine for dengue. You can prevent it by avoiding being bitten by mosquitoes.

The following can reduce your risk of being bitten:
- use insect repellent - products containing 50 per cent DEET are most effective, but lower concentrations (15-30 per cent DEET) should be used in children, and alternatives to DEET should be used in children younger than two months
- wear loose but protective clothing - mosquitoes can bite through tight-fitting clothes; trousers, long-sleeved shirts, and socks and shoes (not sandals) are ideal
- sleep under a mosquito net - ideally one that has been treated with insecticide
- be aware of your environment - mosquitoes that spread dengue breed in standing water in urban areas

Ebola virus disease,"Ebola is a rare but severe disease caused by the Ebola virus. It is not an airborne disease and can only be transmitted by physical contact with infected individuals, their blood or bodily fluids; or contact with objects contaminated with infected blood or bodily fluids.
","A person infected with Ebola virus will typically develop:
- a high temperature (fever)
- a headache
- joint and muscle pain
- a sore throat
- severe muscle weakness

These symptoms start suddenly between 2 and 21 days after becoming infected.

Diarrhoea, vomiting, a rash, stomach pain, red eyes and reduced kidney and liver function can follow. The person may then bleed internally, and may also bleed from the ears, eyes, nose or mouth.","There's currently no licensed treatment or vaccine for Ebola, although potential new vaccines and drug therapies are being developed and tested.

Any area affected by an outbreak should be immediately quarantined. People confirmed to have the infection should be treated in isolation in intensive care.

Healthcare workers need to avoid contact with the bodily fluids of their infected patients by taking strict precautions, such as wearing protective equipment.

Ebola virus disease is sometimes fatal. The sooner a person is given care, the better the chance they'll survive.","The Ebola outbreak in west Africa is now over. The risk of catching the infection while travelling to previously affected countries is very small.

But if you're visiting one of these areas, it's still a good idea to follow these simple precautions to minimise your risk of picking up potentially serious infections:
- wash your hands often using soap and water - use alcohol hand rubs when soap isn't available
- make sure fruit and vegetables are properly washed and peeled before you eat them
- avoid physical contact with anyone who has possible symptoms of an infection
- don't handle dead animals or their raw meat
- don't eat ""bushmeat""",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/ebola-virus-disease
Empyema,"Empyema' is the medical term for pockets of pus that have collected inside a body cavity (space). They can form if a bacterial infection is left untreated, or if it fails to fully get better with treatment. Empyema is a serious condition which requires urgent treatment,","An empyema can be distressing and uncomfortable, causing:
- a fever and night sweats
- a lack of energy
- difficulty breathing
- weight loss
- chest pain
- a cough - which can involve coughing up mucus containing pus ","There are a number of treatments for the condition. The health professional looking after your care will discuss the treatment options with you.

Treatment can include:
- antibiotics - some patients will just need antibiotics given intravenously (directly into a vein through a drip)
- chest drain - some patients may need both antibiotics and a chest drain (a flexible plastic tube inserted through the chest wall and into the affected area, to drain fluid)
- surgery - to remove the lung lining if the condition doesn't improve with the treatments above
- stoma - a chest drain is not suitable for all patients - it is an opening made in the chest wall with a special bag placed over it to collect the fluid that leaks from the empyema.  ","The lungs and inside of the chest cavity are lined with a smooth layer called the pleura. These layers are separated by a thin space - the pleural space. This is filled with a small amount of fluid called pleural fluid.

The pleural fluid can sometimes build up and become infected, so that a collection of pus forms. This can thicken and cause areas of the pleura to stick together, creating pockets of pus.

Empyema can worsen to become many more pockets of pus, with thick deposits coating the outer layer of the lungs. These deposits prevent the lungs expanding properly.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/empyema
Febrile seizures,"Febrile seizures (febrile convulsions) are fits that can happen when a child has a fever. They most often happen between the ages of six months and three years. This page has information on febrile seizures, including signs, causes and what to do during a seizure.","It can be frightening and distressing to see your child having a seizure, particularly if it's their first one.

The fits are usually harmless. Almost all children make a complete recovery afterwards.

As a precaution, you may still need to take your child to the nearest hospital or dial 999 for an ambulance - see what to do during a seizure below.

A febrile seizure usually lasts for less than five minutes. If your child is having a febrile seizure, they will usually:
- become stiff and their arms and legs may begin to twitch
- lose consciousness and may wet or soil themselves

They may also vomit and foam at the mouth. Their eyes may also roll back.

After the seizure, your child may be sleepy for up to an hour afterwards. A straightforward febrile seizure like this will usually only happen once during your child's illness.

Occasionally, febrile seizures can last longer than 15 minutes. Symptoms may only affect one area of your child's body.

These are known as complex febrile seizures. The seizure sometimes happens again within 24 hours or during the period your child is ill.","About a third of children who have had a febrile seizure will have another one during a subsequent infection. This often happens within a year of the first one.

This is more likely if:
- the first febrile seizure happened before your child was 18 months old
- there's a history of seizures or epilepsy in your family
- before having their first seizure, your child had a fever that lasted less than an hour or their temperature was under 40C (104F) 
- your child previously had a complex febrile seizure (more than one seizure during their illness)
- your child attends a day care nursery - this increases their chances of developing common childhood infections, such as the flu or chickenpox

It's not recommended your child is given a prescription of regular medicines to prevent further febrile seizures.

There may be exceptional circumstances where medication to prevent recurrent febrile seizures is recommended.  Your GP, or a specialist, will offer advice on this, if this is necessary.","The cause of febrile seizures is unknown. They're linked to the start of a fever, a high temperature of 38C (100.4F) or above.

There may also be a genetic link to febrile seizures. The chances of having a seizure are increased if a close family member has a history of them.

In most cases, the high temperature is caused by an infection. Common examples are chickenpox, flu, a middle ear infection or tonsillitis.  

In rare cases, febrile seizures can occur after a child has a vaccination.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/febrile-seizures
Fungal nail infection,"Fungal nail infections are common. They are not usually serious, but can be unpleasant and take a long time to treat. Fungal nail infections usually affect your toenails but you can get them on your finger nails too.","A fungal nail infection may not cause any obvious symptoms at first.

As it progresses, the infection can cause:
- discolouration of the nail - it may turn white, black, yellow or green
- thickening and distortion of the nail - it may become an unusual shape or texture and be difficult to trim
- pain or discomfort - particularly when using or placing pressure on the affected toe or finger
- brittle or crumbly nails - pieces may break off and come away completely

Sometimes the skin nearby may also become infected. The skin can be itchy and cracked or red and swollen.","Treatment isn't always needed for a mild fungal nail infection. This is because it's unlikely to cause any further problems and you may feel it's not worth treating.

Speak to your pharmacist if you're bothered by the appearance of the affected nail, or it's causing problems such as pain and discomfort.

They'll be able to recommend something that can help. If it is not clearing up, you can see your GP, who may prescribe a treatment.","You can reduce your risk of developing a fungal nail infection by:
- keeping your hands and feet clean and dry
- wearing well-fitting shoes made of natural materials and clean cotton socks - these will allow your feet to ’breathe’
- clipping your nails to keep them short - don't share clippers or scissors with other people
- not sharing towels and socks with other people, and make sure your towels are washed regularly
- not walking around barefoot in public pools, showers, and locker rooms - special shower shoes are available to protect your feet
- replacing old footwear that could be contaminated with fungi

Flat feet,"Having flat feet, or 'fallen arches', means that your feet have low or no arches and press almost completely flat against the ground.","The arch, or instep, is the middle part of the foot. It is usually raised off the ground when you stand, while the rest of the foot remains flat on the ground.

In young children, this arch isn't always visible because of the baby fat and soft tissue in their feet. It usually develops and appears as they get older.

But some people never really develop this arch. Sometimes this is because they inherited flat feet from their parents.","Flat feet only need to be treated if you have an associated problem, such as pain, overpronation or an underlying health condition.

Non-surgical treatments are often recommended first. Surgery may be needed in some cases.

#Non-surgical treatments
Your GP or podiatrist may recommend:
- wearing supportive shoes that fit well
- wearing specially made insoles (orthotics) inside your shoes to support your feet and stop them rolling inwards
- taking painkillers if you have any discomfort
- losing weight if you're overweight
- stretching the muscles and connective tissues in your lower legs to help stop your foot rolling over - you may be referred to a physiotherapist(external link opens in a new window / tab), who can recommend some exercises to try

These treatments won't change the shape of the feet. But they may help relieve some of the problems associated with flat feet.

If these measures don't help, you may be referred to an orthopaedic surgeon to discuss whether surgery is an option.

#Surgery
Surgery is normally only considered if the treatments above haven't helped. It may also be considered if you have an underlying problem that can be corrected with an operation, such as abnormally developed bones in the feet.

The surgical procedure recommended for you will depend on the cause of your flat feet.

Your surgeon will talk to you about the operation you may need and what this involves.","Many people simply inherit flat feet from their parents.

Occasionally, flat feet can be the result of:
- the feet bones not forming properly in the womb
- loose connective tissue throughout the body, such as in Ehlers-Danlos syndrome or joint hypermobility syndrome
- a condition affecting the muscles and nerves, such as cerebral palsy, spina bifida or muscular dystrophy

But if a gallstone becomes trapped in a duct (tube connecting to the gallbladder) or irritates the inside of the gallbladder it can cause a sudden severe abdominal (tummy) pain.

The pain can be felt:
- in the midline of your abdomen (tummy), above the umbilicus (belly button)
- just under the ribs on your right-hand side - it may spread from here to your side or shoulder blade

The pain is sometimes triggered by eating fatty foods, but may occur at any time of day and it may wake you up during the night.

Some people with gallstones can also develop complications, such as inflammation of the gallbladder (cholecystitis), which can cause:
- persistent pain
- jaundice (a term used to describe the yellowing of the skin and the whites of the eyes.  It's caused by a build-up of a substance called bilirubin in the blood and body's tissues)
- a fever","Treatment is usually only necessary if gallstones are causing:
- symptoms - such as abdominal pain
- complications - such as jaundice or acute pancreatitis (a serious condition where the pancreas becomes inflamed over a short period of time). The pancreas is a small organ located behind the stomach and below the ribcage.

In these cases, surgery to remove the stone or the gallbladder may be recommended.","From the limited evidence available, changes to your diet and losing weight (if you're overweight) may help prevent gallstones.

A healthy, balanced diet is recommended. This includes plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables (at least five portions a day) and wholegrains.

Being overweight, particularly being obese, increases the amount of cholesterol in your bile, which increases your risk of developing gallstones. You can control your weight by eating a healthy diet and taking plenty of regular exercise.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/gallstones
Gangrene,"Gangrene is a serious condition where a loss of blood supply causes body tissue to die. It can affect any part of the body but typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers and hands. The earlier treatment for gangrene begins, the more effective it's likely to be, (see symptoms section).","The symptoms of gangrene vary depending on the cause. It can affect any part of the body. But it typically starts in the toes, feet, fingers or hands.

General symptoms of gangrene include:
- initial redness and swelling 
- either a loss of sensation or severe pain in the affected area
- sores or blisters that bleed or release a dirty-looking or foul-smelling discharge (if the gangrene is caused by an infection)
- the skin becoming cold and pale

In some cases, the affected limb may feel heavy and pressing the skin may produce a crackling sound. These symptoms are caused by a build-up of gas under the skin.

If the area is infected, you may also have other signs related to the underlying infection, such as:
- a high temperature (fever)
- loss of appetite
- rapid heartbeat and breathing
- dizziness
- shivering

Without treatment the affected tissue will start to die. When this happens, the area changes colour from red to brown to purple or black, before shrivelling up and falling away from the surrounding healthy tissue.","The earlier treatment for gangrene begins, the more successful it's likely to be. The main treatments include surgery to remove damaged tissue and antibiotics to treat any underlying infection.

In some cases, surgery may be needed to restore blood flow to the affected area.

In more severe cases, it may be necessary to remove an entire body part such as a toe, foot, or lower leg. This is known as amputation.","Many cases of gangrene can be prevented.

If you have a condition that increases your risk of getting gangrene, such as diabetes, it's important you have regular check-ups to assess the state of your feet.

Report any problems to your GP as soon as possible.

Stopping smoking if you smoke and adopting a healthy lifestyle, with a low-fat diet and regular exercise, can also improve your circulation and reduce your risk of developing gangrene.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/gangrene
Haemophilia,"Haemophilia is a rare condition that affects the blood's ability to clot. It's usually inherited, and most people who have it are male. There’s no cure, but with treatment you can live a normal life.","Normally, when you cut yourself, substances in the blood known as clotting factors combine with blood cells called platelets to make the blood sticky. This makes the bleeding stop eventually.

People with haemophilia don't have as many clotting factors in their blood. This means they bleed for longer than usual.

The symptoms of haemophilia can be mild to severe, depending on the level of clotting factors you have.

The main symptom is bleeding that doesn't stop, also called prolonged bleeding.

People with haemophilia may have:
- nosebleeds that take a long time to stop
- bleeding from wounds that lasts a long time
- bleeding gums
- skin that bruises easily
- pain and stiffness around joints, such as elbows, because of bleeding inside the body (internal bleeding)","There's no cure for haemophilia, but treatment usually allows a person with the condition to have a good quality of life.

Genetically engineered clotting factor medicines are used to prevent and treat prolonged bleeding. These medicines are given as an injection. 

In milder cases, injections are usually only given in response to prolonged bleeding. More severe cases are treated with regular injections to prevent bleeding.","At this time, there is no way to prevent hemophilia in someone who inherits a defective gene and thus produces too little clotting factor. If hemophilia runs in your family, you can be tested to see whether you carry the defective gene and receive counseling about your chance for having children with hemophilia.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/haemophilia
Hay fever,Hay fever is a common allergic reaction to pollen. It is a common cause of allergic irritation of the nose (allergic rhinitis).,"You'll experience hay fever symptoms if you have an allergic reaction to pollen. Pollen is a fine powder released by plants as part of their reproductive cycle. 

You can have an allergy to:
- tree pollen, released during spring
- grass pollen, released during the end of spring and beginning of summer
- weed pollen, released late autumn

Hay fever symptoms vary in severity and may be worse some years. This will depend on the weather conditions and pollen count. The time of year your symptoms start will depend on the types of pollen you're allergic to.

Many people find their symptoms improve as they get older. The symptoms of hay fever include:
- frequent sneezing
- runny or blocked nose
- itchy, red or watery eyes (allergic conjunctivitis)
- an itchy throat, mouth, nose and ears
- cough, caused by postnasal drip (mucus dripping down the throat from the back of the nose)

Less commonly, you may also experience:
- the loss of your sense of smell (anosmia)
- facial pain (caused by blocked sinuses)
- headaches
- earache
- tiredness and fatigue

Even though your hay fever symptoms may be mild, they can interfere with your sleep and your daily activities at school or work.","There's currently no cure for hay fever. However most people are able to relieve symptoms with treatment, at least to a certain extent.

Hay fever can often be controlled using over-the-counter medication from your pharmacist. However, if your symptoms are not improving it’s worth speaking to your GP, as you may require prescription medication.

Treatment options for hay fever include, tablets, nasal sprays and eye drops. The medications include:
- antihistamines
- cromoglycates
- corticosteroids (steroids)

Antihistamines and cromoglycates can help to prevent an allergic reaction from occurring, or reduce the severity of the reaction. Corticosteroids (steroids) help to reduce inflammation and swelling, which result from the allergic reaction.","It's very difficult to completely avoid pollen. However, reducing your exposure to the substances that trigger your hay fever should ease your symptoms.

Rubbing a small amount of petroleum gel inside your lower nostrils can help to prevent pollen from entering your nasal passages.

#Staying indoors 
If possible, stay indoors when the pollen count is high (over 50). The tips below may help to reduce your exposure to pollen.
- keep windows and doors shut in your house -  if it gets too warm, draw the curtains to keep out the sun and lower the temperature
- don't keep fresh flowers in the house
- vacuum regularly, ideally using a machine with a high-efficiency particle arresting (HEPA) filter
- damp dust regularly - dusting with a wet cloth, rather than a dry one, will collect the dust and stop any pollen being spread around
- keep pets out of the house during the hay fever season - if your pet does come indoors, wash them regularly to remove any pollen from their fur
- don't smoke or let other people smoke in your house - smoking and breathing in other people's smoke will irritate the lining of your nose, eyes, throat and airways, making your symptoms worse
- if possible, avoid drying clothes outside - this will help to stop pollen being brought into your house

#Avoiding pollen outside 
If it is not possible to reduce the amount of time you have to spend outside when the pollen count is high, or you're travelling, the tips below may help to reduce your exposure to pollen.

- avoid cutting grass, playing or walking in grassy areas and camping - particularly in the early morning, evening and at night, when the pollen count is at its highest
- wear wraparound sunglasses to stop pollen getting in your eyes
- take a shower and change your clothes after being outdoors to remove the pollen on your body
- keep car windows closed - you can buy a pollen filter for the air vents in your car, which will need to be changed every time the car is serviced

Iron deficiency anaemia,Iron deficiency anaemia is a condition where a lack of iron in the body leads to a reduction in red blood cells. You should see your GP if you experience symptoms of iron deficiency anaemia (see symptoms section).,"There are several different types of anaemia. Each type has a different cause. Iron deficiency anaemia is the most common type.

Other types of anaemia can be caused by a lack of vitamin B12 or folate in the body. 

Many people with iron deficiency anaemia only have a few symptoms. You may notice symptoms immediately. They may also develop gradually if your anaemia is caused by a long-term problem, such as a stomach ulcer.

The most common symptoms include:
- tiredness and lack of energy (lethargy)
- shortness of breath 
- noticeable heartbeats (heart palpitations)
- a pale complexion

Less common symptoms include:
- headache 
- hearing sounds that come from inside the body, rather than from an outside source (tinnitus)
- an altered sense of taste
- feeling itchy
- a sore or abnormally smooth tongue
- hair loss
- a desire to eat non-food items, such as ice, paper or clay (pica)
- difficulty swallowing (dysphagia)
- painful open sores (ulcers) on the corners of your mouth
- spoon-shaped nails","Treatment for iron deficiency anaemia involves taking iron supplements to boost the low levels of iron in your body. This is usually effective, and the condition rarely causes long-term problems.

You'll need to be monitored every few months to check the treatment is working and your iron levels have returned to normal.

The underlying cause will need to be treated so you don't get anaemia again. Increasing the amount of iron in your diet may also be recommended.

Good sources of iron include:
- dark-green leafy vegetables, such as watercress and spinach
- iron-fortified cereals or bread
- brown rice 
- pulses and beans
- nuts and seeds
- meat, fish and tofu
- eggs
- dried fruit, such as dried apricots, prunes and raisins","There are many things that can lead to a lack of iron in the body. In men and post-menopausal women, the most common cause is bleeding in the stomach and intestines.

This can be caused by:
- a stomach ulcer
- stomach cancer
- bowel cancer
- taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)

In women of reproductive age, heavy periods and pregnancy are the most common causes of iron deficiency anaemia. This is due to your body needing extra iron for your baby during pregnancy.

Unless you're pregnant, it's rare for iron deficiency anaemia to be caused just by a lack of iron in your diet. However, if you do lack dietary iron, it may mean you're more likely to develop anaemia than if you have one of the problems mentioned above.",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/iron-deficiency-anaemia
Jet lag,Jet lag is when your normal sleep pattern is disturbed after a long flight. Symptoms usually improve within a few days as your body adjusts to the new time zone.,"The main symptoms are sleep-related. They include:
- difficulty sleeping at bedtime and waking up in the morning
- tiredness and exhaustion
- finding it difficult to stay awake during the day
- poor sleep quality
- concentration and memory problems

Jet lag can also be associated with indigestion, constipation, diarrhoea and bloating.","Symptoms of jet lag often improve after a few days as your body clock adjusts to the new time zone and so medicines aren't usually needed.

Sleeping tablets may be helpful if you're having problems sleeping (insomnia). They can be addictive so should only be used for a short time and if symptoms are severe.

Melatonin is a chemical released by the body in the evening to let your brain know it's time to sleep. Melatonin supplements aren't recommended for jet lag because there isn't enough evidence that they work.","Jet lag can't be prevented, but there are things you can do to help reduce its effects.

#Before you travel
Some things you can do before travelling include:
- getting plenty of rest
- relaxing before going to bed and follow good sleep practices
- gradually change your sleep routine - start going to bed and getting up an hour or two earlier or later than usual (in line with the time of your destination)
- avoid eating large meals, exercise, using electronic gadgets, or drinking alcohol or caffeinated drinks before bedtime

#During your flight
During your flight you should:
- drink plenty of water
- sleep if it's a normal time for sleeping at your destination
- use an eye mask and earplugs if they help you sleep
- keep active by stretching and regularly walking around the cabin
- avoid drinking too much caffeine or alcohol - they can make jet lag worse

#After you arrive
After arriving you should:
- change your sleep schedule to the new time zone as quickly as possible
- set an alarm to avoid oversleeping in the morning
- go outside during the day - natural light will help your body clock adjust
- not go to sleep until a reasonable hour for your new destination

If your trip is short it may be better to stay on ""home time"". If possible, eat and sleep at the times you would at home.",FALSE,"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/jet-lag
