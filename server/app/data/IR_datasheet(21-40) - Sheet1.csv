Urticaria (hives),"Urticaria (hives) is a raised, itchy rash that appears on the skin. Children are often affected by the condition, as well as women aged 30 to 60, and people with a history of allergies. Hives rashes usually improve within a few minutes to a few days.","Urticaria may appear on one part of the body or be spread across large areas. 

It can lead to a red, raised, itchy rash. The rash can be in one place or spread through the body. The raised areas on the skin are sometimes called hives or weals.

The raised areas can range from a few millimetres to the size of a hand.

Doctors may call urticaria either:
- acute urticaria - if the rash clears completely within six weeks (most cases last 24 to 48 hours)
- chronic urticaria - in rarer cases, where the rash persists or comes and goes for more than six weeks, often over many years

A much rarer type of urticaria, known as urticarial vasculitis, can cause blood vessels inside the skin to become inflamed. 

In these cases, the raised areas or weals last longer than 24 hours, are more painful, and can leave a bruise.","Most cases of urticaria don't need treatment. This is because the symptoms are usually mild and often get better within a few days.

If the itchiness is causing you discomfort, antihistamines can help. Antihistamines are available over the counter at pharmacies. 

Your pharmacist can give you advice about the best treatment to treat the rash.

Your GP may consider a short course of steroid tablets (oral corticosteroids) for more severe cases of urticaria. This treatment is not used routinely.

If you have persistent urticaria, you may be referred to a skin specialist (dermatologist).","Urticaria occurs when a trigger causes high levels of histamine and other chemical messengers to be released in the skin. This extra fluid in the tissues causes swelling and itchiness.

Histamine is released for many reasons, including:
- an allergic reaction - such as a food allergy or a reaction to an insect bite or sting
- cold or heat exposure 
- infection - such as a cold
- certain medications - check the patient information leaflet with your medication to see if urticaria is a usual side effect; or if you need advice speak to your pharmacist or GP

In many cases of urticaria, no obvious cause can be found.

Some cases of long-term urticaria may be caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy tissue. This can be difficult to treat, and your GP may refer you to a specialist  for tests and treatment.

Certain triggers may also make the symptoms worse. These include:
- drinking alcohol or caffeine
- emotional stress
- warm temperature",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/urticaria-hives
Nappy rash,Nappy rash occurs when the skin around the baby's nappy area becomes irritated. ,"There may be red patches on your baby's bottom, or the whole area may be red. Their skin may look sore and feel hot to touch, and there may be spots, pimples or blisters.","If your baby gets nappy rash, you can usually treat their skin yourself.

If the rash isn't upsetting your baby, at each nappy change apply a thin layer of a barrier cream to protect their skin. Ask your health visitor or pharmacist to recommend one.

Follow this advice to help look after your baby's skin.
- Change wet or dirty nappies as soon as possible.
- Clean the whole nappy area gently but thoroughly, wiping from front to back. Use water or fragrance-free and alcohol-free baby wipes. Read more about how to clean your baby and change your baby's nappy.
- Bath your baby daily - but avoid bathing them more than twice a day as that may dry out their skin.
- Dry your baby gently after washing them - avoid vigorous rubbing.
- Lie your baby on a towel and leave their nappy off for as long and as often as you can to let fresh air get to their skin.
- Do not use soap, bubble bath, or lotions.
- Do not use talcum powder as it contains ingredients that could irritate your baby's skin.
- Make sure your baby’s nappy fits properly. If it is too tight then it can irritate the skin and if it is too loose, then the nappy will not be able to soak up pee properly.

Nappy rash usually clears up after about 3 days if you follow this advice. You should keep following this advice as this will help prevent nappy rash from coming back.

If the rash is causing your baby discomfort, your health visitor or pharmacist can recommend a nappy rash cream to treat it.

You should apply the cream first and wait a few minutes before you apply the barrier cream.","Nappy rash can be caused by:
- your baby's skin being in contact with wee or poo for a long time
- the nappy rubbing against your baby's skin
- not cleaning the nappy area or changing the nappy often enough
- soap, detergent or bubble bath
- alcohol-based baby wipes
- some types of medicines, such as antibiotics or laxatives (used to make a baby poo more often)",TRUE,https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/baby/caring-for-a-newborn/nappy-rash/
"Hand, foot and mouth disease","Hand, foot and mouth disease typically affects children younger than 10 years of age, and most commonly occurs in children younger than 4 years of age. It can affect adults. It’s a viral infection not needing an antibiotic and usually clears up by itself in 7 to 10 days.","The first signs of hand, foot and mouth disease can be:
- a sore throat
- a high temperature, above 38C
- not wanting to eat

After a few days mouth ulcers and a rash will appear. Ulcers appear in the mouth and on the tongue. These can be painful and make it difficult to eat or drink.

Red spots, which develop into blisters, usually appear on the hands and feet. The blisters are grey in the centre and can be painful.

The symptoms are usually the same in adults and children, but they can be much worse in adults.

It's possible to get hand, foot and mouth disease more than once.

Hand, foot and mouth disease has nothing to do with foot and mouth disease that affects farm animals.","#How to treat the condition yourself
You can't take antibiotics or medicines to cure hand, foot and mouth disease - it has to run its course. It usually gets better in 7 to 10 days.

To help with the symptoms:
- drink fluids to prevent dehydration - avoid acidic drinks such as fruit juice
- eat soft foods like soup - avoid hot and spicy foods
- take paracetamol(external link opens in a new window / tab) or ibuprofen(external link opens in a new window / tab) to help ease a sore mouth or throat

#A pharmacist can help
A pharmacist can help with hand, foot and mouth disease

Speak to your pharmacist for advice about treatments, such as mouth ulcer gels, sprays and mouthwashes to relieve pain.

They can tell you which ones are suitable for children.","#How to stop the condition spreading
Hand, foot and mouth disease is easily passed on to other people. It's spread in coughs, sneezes and poo.

You're infectious from a few days before you have any symptoms. But you're most likely to give it to others in the first 5 days after symptoms start.

To reduce the risk of spreading hand, foot and mouth disease:
- wash your hands often with warm soapy water - and teach children to do so
- use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible
- don't share towels or household items - like cups or cutlery
- wash soiled bedding and clothing on a hot wash

#Staying off school or nursery
Keep your child off school or nursery while they are feeling unwell.

But as soon as they're feeling better, they can go back to school or nursery. There's no need to wait until all the blisters have healed. Keeping your child off for longer is unlikely to stop the illness spreading.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/hand-foot-and-mouth-disease
Impetigo,"Impetigo is a common and highly contagious skin infection that causes sores and sometimes blisters. It's not usually serious and often improves within a week of treatment. Impetigo can affect people of any age, but it tends to affect children more often than adults.","There are two main types of impetigo:
- the most common type is known as non-bullous impetigo, in which blisters are not present
- the less common form, bullous impetigo, in which fluid-filled blisters (bullae) are present

With non-bullous impetigo there are usually no significant symptoms, although there may be some itching.

Other symptoms are uncommon unless the infection is widespread. In bullous impetigo, the area of the blisters tends to be painful and symptoms such as weakness, fever, and diarrhoea are more common.

Since non-bullous impetigo does not usually cause any symptoms, people can easily pass the infection on to others without realising it.

Good hygiene measures are important to help healing and stop the infection spreading to other parts of the body and to other people.

The symptoms of non-bullous and bullous impetigo are described below.

#Non-bullous impetigo 
The symptoms of non-bullous impetigo:
- Begin with the appearance of red sores - usually around the nose and mouth but other areas of the face and the limbs can also be affected
- The sores quickly burst leaving behind thick, golden crusts typically around 2cm across - the appearance of these crusts is sometimes likened to cornflakes stuck to the skin
- After the crusts dry, they leave a red mark that usually heals without scarring - the time it takes for the redness to disappear can vary between a few days and a few weeks
- The sores are not painful, but they may be itchy - It's important not to touch, or scratch, the sores because this can spread the infection to other parts of your body, and to other people

Other symptoms, such as a high temperature (fever) and swollen glands, are rare but can occur in more severe cases.

#Bullous impetigo 
The symptoms of bullous impetigo:
- Begin with the appearance of fluid-filled blisters (bullae) which usually occur on the trunk (the central part of the body between the waist and neck) or on the arms and legs and are usually about 1-2cm across
- The blisters may quickly spread, before bursting after several days - this exposes a raw and painful skin lesion, before forming a leave a yellow crust that usually heals without leaving any scarring
- The blisters may be painful and the area of skin surrounding them may be itchy - as with non-bullous impetigo, it is important that you do not touch or scratch the affected areas of the skin

Symptoms of weakness, fever, diarrhoea and swollen glands are more common in cases of bullous impetigo.","Impetigo usually gets better without treatment in about two to three weeks. However, treatment is often recommended because it can reduce the length of the illness to around seven to 10 days. It can also help lower the risk of the infection being spread to others.

The main treatments prescribed are antibiotic creams or antibiotic tablets. These usually have to be used for about a week.

During treatment, it's important to take precautions to minimise the risk of impetigo spreading to other people or other areas of the body, such as by:
- not touching the sores whenever possible
- washing your hands regularly 
- not sharing flannels, sheets or towels
- staying away from work, school, nursery, playgroup or childminders until lesions are crusted and healed, or 48 hours after antibiotic treatment has started  

Most people are no longer contagious after 48 hours of treatment or once their sores have dried and healed.","As impetigo is a highly contagious condition, it is important to take precautions to reduce the risk of the infection spreading.

The advice below can help to prevent the spread of the infection to other people or to other areas of the body:
- Stay away from work, school, nursery, playgroup or childminders (or other places where the infection could be spread) until lesions are crusted and healed, or 48 hours after antibiotic treatment has started
- Don't share flannels, sheets or towels with anyone who has impetigo, and wash them at a high temperature after use
- Wash the sores with soap and water, and cover them loosely with a gauze bandage or clothing if possible
- Avoid touching the sores, or letting others touch them, whenever possible
- Don't scratch the affected areas and make sure your or your child's nails are kept clean and short to reduce the risk of further damage caused by scratching
- Avoid contact with new-born babies, preparing food, playing contact sports, or going to the gym until the risk of infection has passed (when the rash has crusted over, or after at least 48 hours of treatment with antibiotics)
- Wash your hands often, particularly after touching infected skin
- Washable toys should also be washed - wipe non-washable soft toys thoroughly with a cloth that has been wrung out in detergent and warm water and allowed to dry completely",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/impetigo
Ringworm,"Ringworm is a common fungal infection that can cause a red or silvery ring-like rash on the skin. Ringworm commonly affects arms and legs, but it can appear almost anywhere on the body. Despite its name, ringworm doesn't have anything to do with worms.","The symptoms of ringworm include: 
- a ring-like red or silvery rash on your skin - your skin will look red and irritated around the ring, but healthy inside
- scaly, itchy and inflamed skin 

In more severe cases:  
- he rings may multiply, grow in size and merge together 
- the rings may feel slightly raised and the skin underneath may be itchy 
- blisters and pus-filled sores may form around the rings 

The ring spreads outwards as it progresses. You can have one patch or several patches of ringworm.  In more serious cases, your skin may become raised and blistered.

#Head, face and neck ringworm
Ringworm on the face and neck may not appear ring-shaped, but may be itchy and swollen, and it can become dry and crusted. 

If you have a beard, you may notice patches of hair breaking away, or patches of hair loss on your head if you have ringworm infection in the scalp.

#Hand ringworm
Ringworm on the hand often causes the skin to become thicker on the palm and in between the fingers. It may affect one hand or both and normally only appears on one side.","Most ringworm infections are mild and can be treated by an antifungal cream from your local pharmacy.

Talk to your pharmacist first, and you may also need to see your GP to confirm a diagnosis.

Scalp infections can be treated with antifungal tablets, sometimes together with antifungal shampoo.

If the skin is irritated or broken, it can lead to other bacterial infections, which may need treatment with antibiotics.","It's important to prevent the infection spreading. You should avoid sharing towels, bedding or clothes with someone with a fungal infection.

If you think your pet has ringworm, take it to the vet. If your pet is treated quickly, you’ll be less likely to catch it.

If your child has a fungal infection, they can go to school, but you should let their teacher know.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/ringworm
Scabies,"Scabies is a skin condition caused by tiny mites that burrow into the skin. It can be spread from one person to another. Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.","Cellulitis is usually treated with antibiotics.

Many infections can be treated with antibiotic tablets at home.

You'll usually be given a course of tablets to take, and your symptoms should start to improve after a few days.

Make sure you complete the whole course of medicine you've been given, even if you're feeling better. Contact your GP if your symptoms get worse after a few days or don't improve within a week.

For serious infections, treatment is usually started in hospital. You'll normally be given antibiotics directly into a vein.","Visit your GP if you think you have scabies. It's not usually a serious condition, but it does need to be treated.

Your GP will discuss your treatment with you. The treatments most widely used are a cream and lotion.

If your partner has been diagnosed with genital scabies, to avoid reinfection you should visit your nearest sexual health clinic. This is so you can be checked and, if necessary, treated.

Avoid having sex and other forms of close bodily contact until both you and your partner have completed the full course of treatment.","Scabies is usually spread through long periods of skin-to-skin contact with an infected person, or through sexual contact.

It can take up to eight weeks for the symptoms of scabies to appear after the initial infection.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/scabies
Slapped cheek syndrome,Slapped cheek syndrome (fifth disease) is common in children and should clear up on its own within three weeks. It's rarer in adults but can be more serious.,"#How to check if it's slapped cheek syndrome
The first sign of slapped cheek syndrome is usually feeling unwell for a few days. Symptoms may include:
- a high temperature of 38C or more
- a runny nose and sore throat
- headache

After one to three days, a bright red rash usually appears on both cheeks. Adults don't always get the rash. 

After one to three days with a cheek rash, a light-pink body rash may appear. The skin is raised and can be itchy.

#How long it lasts
The cheek rash normally fades within two weeks.

The body rash also fades within two weeks. It sometimes comes and goes for up to a month - especially if you're exercising, hot, anxious or stressed.

Adults might also have joint pain and stiffness. This can continue for many weeks, even after the other symptoms have gone.","You don't usually need to see a GP for slapped cheek syndrome. There are some things you can do to help ease symptoms while it clears up.

These include:
- resting
- drinking plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration - babies should continue their normal feeds
- taking paracetamol (external link opens in a new window / tab)or ibuprofen(external link opens in a new window / tab) for a high temperature, headaches or joint pain
- using moisturiser on itchy skin
- speaking to a pharmacist if you have itchy skin - they can recommend the best antihistamine for children

Aspirin should never be given to children under the age of 16.

Tell your midwife or GP if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system and have been near someone with slapped cheek syndrome.","It's hard to avoid spreading slapped cheek syndrome because most people don't know they have it until they get the rash. You can only spread the infection to other people before the rash appears.

Slapped cheek syndrome is caused by a virus. The virus spreads to other people, surfaces or objects by coughing or sneezing near them.

To reduce the risk of spreading the virus:
- wash your hands often with warm water and soap
- use tissues to trap germs when you cough or sneeze
- bin used tissues as quickly as possible

#Rash
The rash comes on suddenly and develops over a few days. It tends to start on the hands or feet, before spreading to the limbs, upper body and face.

The rash:
- starts as small red spots, which may become raised patches a few centimetres in size
- often has patches that look like a target or ""bulls-eye"", with a dark red centre that may have a blister or crust, surrounded by a pale pink ring and a darker outermost ring
- may be slightly itchy or uncomfortable

They're most often found:
- in the armpit
- behind the knees
- on the groin

MC can affect a person on more than one occasion, but this is uncommon.

It’s common for it to spread around the body and can take up to 18 months to clear completely.","Routine treatment for MC, particularly in children, is generally not recommended because:
- the infection usually clears up on its own
- the infection doesn't normally cause any symptoms other than the spots
- the infection doesn't usually interfere with everyday activities, such as going to work, swimming or playing sports
- treatments can be painful and may cause scarring or damage to the surrounding skin

Treatment is usually only recommended for older children and adults when the spots are particularly unsightly and affect quality of life, or for people with weakened immune systems.

In such cases, treatments that may be offered include:
- liquids, gels or creams that are applied directly to the skin
- minor procedures such as cryotherapy (where the spots are removed by freezing them)","Although MC is infectious, the chance of passing it on to others during normal activities is small.

It's not necessary to:
- stay away from work, school or nursery
- stop doing activities such as swimming

You should take steps to avoid spreading the virus to other people. You should:
- avoid squeezing or scratching the spots - as well as increasing the risk of the infection spreading, this can cause pain, bleeding and can lead to scarring
- keep affected areas of skin covered with clothing whenever possible - a waterproof bandage can be put over the area if you go swimming

#Feeling unwell 
Some people feel unwell for a few days before they get the rash, with symptoms such as a headache, fever and joint pain.

#The herald patch 
A single pink or red oval patch of scaly skin, known as the ""herald patch"", usually appears at least two days before a more widespread rash develops.

It ranges in size from 2cm to 10cm. It can appear on your tummy, chest, back or neck, and less commonly on the face or scalp, or near your genitals.

#Widespread rash 
A few days to two weeks later, a more widespread rash develops, which may continue to spread over the following 2 to 6 weeks.

It consists of smaller raised scaly patches that usually range in size from 0.5cm to 1.5cm. Most people get many patches across their chest, back, tummy, neck, upper arms and upper thighs. The face is usually unaffected.

In light-skinned people, the patches are usually a pinkish-reddish colour. In dark-skinned people, the patches can sometimes be grey, dark brown or black.

The rash isn't painful, but it can sometimes be itchy.

Both the herald patch and rash usually last for 2 to 12 weeks, although they can last for up to 5 months.

After the rash has gone, you may have some darker or lighter areas of skin. These should return to normal within a few months and won't leave permanent scarring.","Pityriasis rosea usually clears up without treatment within 12 weeks.

- drinking plenty of fluid to avoid dehydration

Things you can do to calm the itching or prickly rash include:
- applying something cold, such as a damp cloth or ice pack (wrapped in a tea towel) for no more than 20 minutes
- tapping or patting the rash instead of scratching it
- not  using perfumed shower gels or creams","Heat rash is usually caused by excessive sweating.

There are several different types of psoriasis. Many people have only one form of psoriasis at a time, although two different types can occur together.

Guttate psoriasis also known as ‘tear drop’ or ‘rain drop’ psoriasis, is a widespread rash of small spots. It can occur at any age, but tends to occur  most often in children, adolescents and younger adults.

Usually, guttate psoriasis is widespread across the torso, back and limbs, and clears up after several weeks or months, depending on how quickly treatment is started.

Some people may continue to have flares from time to time, or find it evolves into one of the other types of psoriasis

One type may change into another type, or become more severe.

Most cases of psoriasis go through cycles, causing problems for a few weeks or months before easing or stopping.

You should see your GP if you think you may have psoriasis.","There's no cure for psoriasis. A range of treatments, including creams and ointments, can improve symptoms and the appearance of skin patches.

The health professional looking after your care will discuss treatment options with you.
","People with psoriasis have an increased production of skin cells.

The build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis.

Although the process isn't fully understood, it's thought to be related to a problem with the immune system.

Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a ""trigger"". Possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines.

The condition isn't contagious. It can't be spread from person to person.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/psoriasis
Scarlet fever,Scarlet fever is a bacterial illness that mainly affects children. It causes a distinctive pink-red rash.,"The symptoms of scarlet fever usually take two to five days to appear after infection.

The symptoms include:
- a sore throat
- headache
- high temperature (38.3C/101F) or above) 
- flushed face and swollen tongue

The distinctive pink-red rash develops 12 to 48 hours later.

#Rash
Red blotches are the first sign of the rash. These turn into a fine pink-red rash that feels like sandpaper to touch. It may also be itchy. The rash usually starts on the chest and stomach before spreading to other areas of the body, such as the ears and neck.

The rash doesn't usually spread to the face. However, the cheeks become flushed and the area just around the mouth stays quite pale. The rash will turn white if you press a glass on it.

Outer layers of skin, usually on the hands and feet, may peel for several weeks afterwards.

Other symptoms may include:
- swollen neck glands
- loss of appetite
- nausea or vomiting
- red lines in the folds of the body, such as the armpit, which may last a couple of days after the rash has gone
- a white coating on the tongue, which peels a few days later leaving the tongue red and swollen (this is known as strawberry tongue)
- a general feeling of being unwell","Most cases of scarlet fever clear up after about a week without treatment. However, treatment is recommended.

Treatment reduces the length of time you're contagious, speeds up recovery and lowers the risk of complications of scarlet fever. Scarlet fever is usually treated with a course of antibiotics.","Scarlet fever is very contagious. It is caused by Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria, also known as group A streptococcus, which are found on the skin and in the throat.

If your child has scarlet fever, you should keep them away from nursery or school for at least 24 hours after starting treatment with antibiotics. Adults with the illness should also stay off work for at least 24 hours after starting treatment.

Children and adults should cover their mouth and nose with a tissue when they cough or sneeze. They should also wash their hands with soap and water after using or disposing of tissues.

There’s currently no vaccine for scarlet fever.

Scarlet fever is a notifiable disease. This means that doctors must report cases to the Director of Public Health so they can monitor the spread of the disease.",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/scarlet-fever
Sore throat,Sore throats are very common and usually nothing to worry about. They normally get better within a week. Most are caused by minor illnesses such as colds or flu and can be treated at home.,Sore throat,"The following measures can often help soothe a sore throat:
- take ibuprofen or paracetamol - paracetamol is better for children and for people who can't take ibuprofen (note that children under 16 should never take aspirin)
- drink plenty of cool or warm fluids, and avoid very hot drinks
- eat cool, soft foods
- avoid smoking and smoky places
- gargle with a homemade mouthwash of warm, salty water
- suck lozenges, hard sweets, ice cubes or ice lollies - but don't give young children anything small and hard to suck because of the risk of choking

There are also products such as medicated lozenges and sprays sold in pharmacies that you may want to try. They don’t treat the infection, but some people find they help with the symptoms.

Antibiotics aren't usually prescribed for a sore throat, as most are not caused by a bacterial infection. Even if it's caused by a bacterial infection, they are unlikely to help if prescribed within the first three days of a sore throat beginning.","The cause of a sore throat isn't always obvious. But in most cases it's a symptom of a viral, (or sometimes a bacterial) infection.

#Common causes 
A sore throat is often a symptom of:
- colds or flu - you may also have a blocked or runny nose, a cough, a high temperature (fever), a headache and general aches
- laryngitis (inflammation of the voice box) - you may also have a hoarse voice, a dry cough and a constant need to clear your throat
- tonsillitis (inflammation of the tonsils) - you may also have red or spotty tonsils, discomfort when swallowing and a fever
- strep throat (a bacterial throat infection) - you may also have swollen glands in your neck, discomfort when swallowing and tonsillitis
- glandular fever - you may also feel very tired and have a fever and swollen glands in your neck

It may also be caused by something irritating your throat, such as smoke, gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (where acid leaks up from the stomach) and allergies.

#Less common causes 
Less often, a sore throat can be a sign of:
- quinsy (a painful collection of pus at the back of the throat) - the pain may be severe and you may also have difficulty opening your mouth or difficulty swallowing
- epiglottitis (inflammation of the flap of tissue at the back of the throat) - the pain may be severe and you may have difficulty breathing and difficulty swallowing

These conditions are more serious and should be seen by a doctor as soon as possible (see below).",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/sore-throat
Whooping cough,"Whooping cough, (pertussis), is a highly contagious bacterial chest infection. It causes repeated coughing bouts and can make babies and young children in particular very ill. In recent years, cases have increased. But it’s still rare due to a vaccination programme that can protect babies and children from the condition.","Whooping cough can affect people of any age, but usually it affects babies and young children. It can make babies and young children very ill. 

Whooping cough is spread in the droplets of the coughs or sneezes of someone with the infection.

The first symptoms of whooping cough are similar to those of a cold, such as:
- a runny nose
- red and watery eyes 
- a sore throat
- a slightly raised temperature

Intense coughing bouts start about a week later:
- the bouts usually last a few minutes at a time and tend to be more common at night
- coughing usually brings up thick mucus and may be followed by vomiting
- between coughs, you or your child may gasp for breath - this may cause a ‘whoop’ sound, although not everyone has this
- the strain of coughing can cause the face to become very red, and there may be some slight bleeding under the skin or in the eyes
- young children can sometimes briefly turn blue (cyanosis) if they have trouble breathing - this often looks worse than it is and their breathing should start again quickly
-in very young babies, the cough may not be particularly noticeable, but there may be brief periods where they stop breathing

The bouts will eventually start to become less severe and less frequent over time. It may be a few months before they stop completely.","Treatment for whooping cough depends on your age and how long you've had the infection.
- children under six months who are very ill and people with severe symptoms will usually be admitted to hospital for treatment
- people diagnosed during the first three weeks of infection may be prescribed antibiotics to take at home - these will help stop the infection spreading to others, but may not reduce the symptoms
- people who've had whooping cough for more than three weeks won't normally need any specific treatment, as they're no longer contagious and antibiotics are unlikely to help

While you or your child are recovering at home, it can help to:
- get plenty of rest
- drink lots of fluids
- clean away mucus and sick from your or your child's mouth
- take medication such as paracetamol or ibuprofen for a fever

Aspirin should not be given to children under 16 years old.

Avoid using cough medicines, as they're not suitable for young children and are unlikely to be of much help.","Vaccinations for whooping cough 
There are routine vaccinations that can protect babies and children from whooping cough.

Though rates have increased in recent years, whooping cough is rare in Northern Ireland (when compared to the time before the vaccine was developed) due to an effective vaccination programme.

High uptake rates of the vaccination programme are essential to keep whooping cough cases down.

These vaccines don't offer lifelong protection from whooping cough. They can help stop children getting it when they're young and more vulnerable to the effects of the infection.

Older children and adults aren't routinely vaccinated, except during pregnancy or a whooping cough outbreak.

Urinary tract infections in children,Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are some of the commonest bacterial infections that GPs treat. UTIs are more common in adults than in children. They can be painful and uncomfortable. But they usually pass within a few days or can be easily treated with a course of antibiotics.,"The urinary tract is where our bodies make and get rid of urine (pee). It comprises the kidneys, and stretches out to the ureters (the tubes connecting the kidneys to the bladder), down to the bladder, and finally the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body).

Infections of the kidneys (pyelonephritis) or ureters are known as upper UTIs. Infections of the bladder (cystitis) or infections of urethra (urethritis) are known as lower UTIs.

It can be difficult to tell whether a child has a UTI, because the symptoms can be vague and young children cannot easily communicate how they feel.

Signs that your child may have an UTI can include:
- a high temperature (fever) (greater than 38°C)
- vomiting
- tiredness
- irritability
- pain or a burning sensation when urinating
- needing to urinate (pee) very often
- wetting themselves or their bed, having previously been dry
- pain in their tummy (abdomen), side or lower back
- unpleasant smelling urine
- blood in their urine","If your child is over three months old and are not thought to be at risk of serious illness, they can usually be treated at home with a course of antibiotics.

The length of treatment will depend on the severity of illness, and whether the lower or upper part of your child's urinary tract is infected. ","It isn't possible to prevent all childhood urinary tract infections (UTIs), but there are some things you can do to reduce the risk of your child getting one.

The following advice may help:
- If possible, breastfeed your baby for the first six months after they are born - this can help improve your baby's immune system
- Encourage your child to wipe their bottom from front to back - this will help to minimise the chances of bacteria entering the urethra (the tube through which urine passes)
- Encourage children to go to the toilet regularly and make sure they are well hydrated - make sure they drink enough to keep their urine pale and clear during the day (speak to your pharmacist about medications that can help if constipation is a persistent problem)
- Avoid nylon and other types of synthetic underwear, as these can help promote the growth of bacteria - loose-fitting cotton underwear should be worn instead
- Avoid using scented soaps or bubble baths, as these can increase your child's risk of developing a UTI",TRUE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/urinary-tract-infections-children
Allergies,"An allergy is a reaction the body has to normally harmless substances, such as pollens, foods and medicines. Usually these substances pose no problem. If you are allergic to a particular substance, your body identifies them as a ‘threat’ and reacts.","Allergic reactions usually happen quickly within a few minutes of exposure to an allergen.

They can cause:
- sneezing
- a runny or blocked nose
- red, itchy, watery eyes
- wheezing and coughing
- a red, itchy rash
- worsening of asthma or eczema symptoms

Most allergic reactions are mild.  Occasionally a severe reaction called anaphylaxis or anaphylactic shock can occur. This is a medical emergency and needs urgent treatment.","In many cases, the most effective way of managing an allergy is to avoid the allergen that causes the reaction whenever possible.

For example, if you have a food allergy, you should check a food's ingredients list for allergens before eating it. The Food Standards Agency has more information about food allergen labelling.

There are also several medications available to help control symptoms of allergic reactions. Your pharmacist will be able to advise you about medication to help with your symptoms.  If these do not help to control your symptoms, you should see your GP.","Allergies occur when the body's immune system reacts to a particular substance as though it's harmful.

It's not clear why this happens. Most people affected have a family history of allergies or have closely related conditions such as asthma or eczema.

Is it an allergy, sensitivity or intolerance?

Below is information to help explain the difference between an allergy, sensitivity or intolerance:
- allergy - a reaction produced by the body's immune system when exposed to a normally harmless substance
- sensitivity - the exaggeration of the normal effects of a substance; for example, the caffeine in a cup of coffee may cause extreme symptoms, such as palpitations and trembling
- intolerance - where a substance causes unpleasant symptoms, such as diarrhoea, but doesn't involve the immune system; people with an intolerance to certain foods can typically eat a small amount without having any problems",FALSE,https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/allergies
Scars,"A scar is a mark left on the skin after a wound or injury has healed. Scars are a natural part of the healing process. Most will fade and become paler over time, although they never completely disappear.","#Types of scars
A scar can be a fine line or a pitted hole on the skin, or an abnormal overgrowth of tissue.

#Normal fine-line scars
A minor wound like a cut will usually heal to leave a red, raised line. It will gradually get paler and flatter over time.

This process can take up to two years. The scar won't disappear completely and you'll be left with a visible mark or line.

Fine-line scars are common following a wound or after surgery. They aren't usually painful, but they may be itchy for a few months.

On darker skin types, the scar tissue may fade to leave a brown or white mark. A pale scar may be more obvious on tanned skin because scar tissue doesn't tan.

#Keloid scars
A keloid scar is an overgrowth of tissue that occurs when too much collagen is produced at the site of the wound.

The scar keeps growing, even after the wound has healed.

Keloid scars are raised above the skin and are red or purple when newly formed, before gradually becoming paler.

They're often itchy or painful, and can restrict movement if they're tight and near a joint.

#Hypertrophic scars
Like keloid scars, hypertrophic scars are the result of excess collagen being produced at the site of a wound.

But not as much collagen is produced in hypertrophic scars compared with keloid scars.

Also, unlike keloid scars, hypertrophic scars don't extend beyond the boundary of the original wound. But they may continue to thicken for up to six months.

Hypertrophic scars are red and raised to start with, before becoming flatter and paler over the course of several years.

#Pitted or sunken scars
Some scars caused by skin conditions, such as acne and chickenpox, can have a sunken or pitted appearance.

Pitted scars, also known as atrophic or ’ice-pick’ scars, can also occur as a result of an injury that causes a loss of underlying fat.

#Scar contractures
Scar contractures are often caused by burns.

They occur when the skin ’shrinks’, leading to tightness and a restriction in movement.
","Complete scar removal isn't possible. But most scars will gradually fade and become paler over time.

A number of treatments are available that may improve a scar's appearance and help make it less visible.

Your GP may refer you to a dermatologist (skin specialist) or a plastic surgeon for treatment.

Some treatments, such as laser therapy, aren't widely available on the health service, so you'll need to pay for them privately.

If scarring is unsightly, uncomfortable or restrictive, treatment options may include:
- topical silicone gel or silicone gel sheets
- pressure dressings
- steroids
- skin camouflage (make-up)
- surgery

In many cases, a combination of treatments can be used.","#How to lessen your chances of scarring:
- Clean the wound.: As soon as you’re injured, clean the affected area with soap and water to get rid of any bacteria and prevent infection.
- Keep it moist and covered.: You might’ve grown up learning to keep cuts dry, but the opposite is true. Keeping it moist is best to prevent a scar. Use petroleum jelly on your wound, and bandage it up to let it heal.
- Avoid bacitracin.: Resist the temptation to apply topical ointment, as 8% of people are actually allergic to it — which can further inflame the area and increase the likelihood of scarring.
- Minimize movement.: Every time the scar moves, it’s going to alter the formation for a wider or thicker scar. Give your wound time to heal by not overexerting the injured area.
- Leave those scabs alone: Scabs are our skin’s natural bandages, so keep your fingers off of them and let them do their thing. Picking will only prolong your injury and keep it from healing. Think you’re picking at scabs in your sleep? Purchase a pair of cotton gloves to wear to bed.

In summary, the bottom line is don’t let it crust up, keep it moist, keep it clean, keep it covered, and minimize tension.",FALSE,"https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/conditions/scars
